The burden on the buyer of new shares also decreased significantly depending on the issuance price of new shares or the discount rate.In the case of CEO Cho, the burden has been further reduced in terms of financing for the acquisition of new shares.

If it is simply calculated at the closing price of last month before the suspension of transactions, the value of minority shareholders' shares will disappear.In response, the company said it is doing its best to resume trading as soon as possible, bowing to shareholders and apologizing for the unpleasant situation.In addition, Binka Oil Field, Terari Sauce's main business, completed its pilot project and is about to produce commercial products, and plans to jointly develop it with Sinopec after horizontal drilling planned for the year.Meanwhile, the exchange says it should wait and see the results as the screening is underway. An exchange official said, ""Whether to delist or not depends on the results of the review by the corporate review committee,"" adding, ""We will make a comprehensive decision after considering various factors.""The Korea Exchange will hold a corporate review committee within days from the date of notification of the subject of substantive examination to conduct deliberation on delisting. As a result of the deliberation, if it falls under the reason for delisting, the company's objection and deliberation by the listing committee will be finalized.Chosun Biz Hot News Implant Shows Inside Smart Car Splits With Full Printer Revolution SquadIt turned out that the people who frequently ate Tylenol were shocked to find out that this is the heaven for securitiesmen who moved to Changtusa."
"TerrariSource announced in a regulatory filing that it would suspend the transfer of stock names to confirm rights shareholders at the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting.

"The exercise of the right to take over the new lease...The exercise of new stock rights accompanied by Terrari Sauce's bonds with new stock rights, which were issued last month, fell to the first adjustment date. As a result, the number of stocks that can be exercised has also increased to Yeomanju, which is nearly twice as large as when it was issued. This is close to the total number of issued stocks. With the stake in Yedang Company, the previous largest shareholder, disappearing, new major shareholders are likely to emerge among investors. The volume of new shares issued has soared.According to the Financial Supervisory Service, which is the new variable of management rights, TerrariSource adjusted the new driving price of the last month's issue from won to won. Accordingly, the number of new shares that can be issued will increase from Manchuria to Manchuria due to the exercise of the right to acquire new shares.The total number of shares issued by existing Terrari sauce is billions of shares. If all new shares are issued at the adjusted event, the number of shares in Terrari sauce will increase to billions of shares. The monthly issue of can be converted into stocks next month. Afterwards, if the current exercise is converted to new stocks, monthly investors will hold a stake in Terrarisos.At the time of issuance, investors had little stake in the event.Terrarisos has disappeared due to opposition from private lenders after the death of the late chairman Byun Doo-seop. It has been confirmed that the stake that disappeared from Yedang's safe was sold to the market through some private lenders. The rest of the unconfirmed volume is likely to have been the same fate. For more than a month after Chairman Byun's death, Terrari Sauce is actually moving to a company without an owner. In order to overcome this situation, the management of Yedang and Terrarisos are steadily trying to find the largest shareholder, but they have yet to achieve results. In this situation, adjustment of events can motivate investors. Although there is time left until next month, converting the already invested into stocks can secure a significant stake.The current management also has investors in mind as candidates for the new owner. A senior Terarisource official said, ""We are trying to persuade some of the investors to become the largest shareholder through additional investment.""The decline in stock prices due to the uncertainty of the absence of the largest shareholder is not a negative factor for them. This is because if stock prices fall further, the amount that the event can secure through adjustment will increase.After Chairman Byun's death, those who invested in Terrarisos stocks suffered huge losses as their stock prices plunged from the original to the original, but investors held a flower plaque.The fate of the last remaining KOSDAQ overseas resource development company is that TerrariSource is the only company that has survived among KOSDAQ overseas resource development companies that have sprung up since Heliotech in the year. Heliatech and many other listed companies continued to develop oil fields alone while they disappeared into the back of the stock market as they were delisted.Since year, the money poured out by TerrariSource has been difficult for KOSDAQ companies to handle. Hundreds of billions of won were invested, including funds for the sale of Yedang Online, a major subsidiary. In addition, Chairman Byun recently had to entrust Terarisource shares and borrow tens of billions of won borrowed from private lenders.Although there is no Chairman Byun who is so focused on oil field development that he sold a game company that played the role of Cash Cow and left his base entertainment business behind, Terarisos management has yet to give up hope for Russia's oil field development business.Jeon Pil-soo's Eyes on Chang economy Looking at the World of Journalists Lee Min-jung Marries Lee Byung-hun, a rich manIn the end, I thought, ""This happened well to my daughter-in-law, Roh Hyun-jung,"" but I thought, ""Oh, no.

"This article was released on Monday in Capital Markets Media Money Today.While Yedang Company, a comprehensive entertainment company, is set to designate whether it will be subject to a substantial review of delisting due to the embezzlement and breach of trust of former chairman Byun Doo-sup, the value of its subsidiary Terrarisos is emerging as an important variable to determine whether it will remain delisted.According to an official of the Korea Exchange in Japan, the Yedang plans to decide whether to designate the subject of the substantive review of delisting on the coming month and then decide whether to delist at the delisting committee on the same month. Even if there is a charge of embezzlement and breach of trust, it is rare if there is no problem with the company's management continuity, such as financial structure, business management transparency, etc., but there is a possibility that it will not be designated as a target for delisting.In the case of Yedang, attention is focused on the impact of the loss of shares in Terarisos, a subsidiary that originated the incident, on the company's financial structure. If Terarisource's stake accounts for about the proportion of total assets, it is expected that the financial structure will deteriorate rapidly.Earlier in the past, the Yedang announced in a public announcement that it would report the loss of Manju among Terrarisus common shares held because the whereabouts of Manju were unknown. Yedang said it estimates that former CEO Byun Doo-sup embezzled some of the lost quantity and provided it as personal debt collateral.As of the end of the quarter, the size of investment assets of related companies is 100 million won out of the total assets of the budget. Among them, the book value of Terrarisos' stake is 100 million won.In other words, if all of the lost 10,000 shares are lost, asset amortization of KRW 100 million will occur if calculated as of the quarter. In this case, the total capital excluding debt from assets will be reduced from KRW 100 million to KRW 100 million, slightly exceeding the capital of Yedang.Yedang has continued to run an operating deficit due to poor operating performance, and accumulated losses amount to 100 million won. If the operating deficit continues this year, capital erosion seems inevitable. The Yedang said it plans to track down the stock number and recover the lost stock, but the market predicts that the company, which is presumed to have provided the debtors with real stock holdings as debt collateral, is unlikely to recover it.An exchange official said, ""In the event of embezzlement and breach of trust, there are often problems with financial position or transparency in management,"" adding, ""We will examine the company's comprehensive details and determine whether it is subject to actual examination.""

"Terrari sauce has been plunging every day as most of the shares of Terrari Sauce, a subsidiary of Yedang Company, have been lost.As of 1 a.m., Terrari sauce was trading at the won, down won from the previous day. Stock prices, which had plunged for consecutive trading days, fell to their original level.On the previous day, Yedang announced in a public announcement that it would report the loss of Manju among the Terrari sauce stocks held because the whereabouts of Manju were unknown. The KOSDAQ market headquarters suspended the trading of Yedang's stock certificates to protect investors.Terarisos is a resource development company that owns a stake in Binkasa, a oil company in Russia's Bashkortostan Republic, and Yedang is the largest shareholder in Terarisos.The securities industry believes that if Yedang fails to find the stocks reported as lost, it is likely to be delisted due to capital erosion. The value of stocks lost by Yedang amounts to KRW 100 million based on the closing price of the previous day.TerrariSource also recently led the oil field business, which could shake the entire business if the largest shareholder changes due to the loss of shares.Yedang plans to track who actually owns the stock based on TerrariSource's stock certificate number to find the lost stock.

"The largest shareholder of Terarisos, an overseas resource development company, has virtually disappeared in the KOSDAQ to recruit the new largest shareholder for normal investors. Terarisos, which is developing Russia's Vinka oil field, has lost its abnormal shareholders as its 10,000 shares held by Yedang Company, the largest shareholder, disappeared.Stock prices, which had been seeking a rebound on the news of the sudden disappearance of the largest shareholder, fell to the lower limit again. Terrarisos, which had hit its lows for the first consecutive day until last week, was out of the low for the first consecutive day, but closed higher during the day.

It is argued that Chairman Byun's stake in Terrarisource, which Yedang held due to personal debt, has disappeared, but the company's operations are working normally.Terarisource is the last overseas resource development company on the KOSDAQ that has looked like a mushroom since last year.

According to the Financial Supervisory Service, the company promoted the resource and renewable energy development projects among the companies that were delisted in the year as new projects. Solid mid-sized companies, which had sales of more than 100 million won, were also on the path of collapse while pursuing resource development.For example, Hansung Elcomtech, which promoted gold mine development in Mongolia, was a solid mobile phone parts company that posted sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won in the early years of resource development. However, it is now seeking a new owner after being given a management improvement period in the delisting review.

"Terrarisos stock Manju, which disappeared after being held by the Herald Economic reporter Park Se-hwan Yedang Company, has been highlighted as the key to solving various suspicions surrounding Yedang. Some speculate that Terarisos shares, whose whereabouts are unknown, may be related to the sudden death of former Yedang Chairman Byun Doo-sup.Suspicions surrounding Yedang have intensified since Yedang announced that it is unknown whereabouts of Manjoo among the common shares of Terrari Sauce, a subsidiary owned by one company.Yedang said that some of the stocks of Terrari Sauce, which disappeared, are believed to have been provided as personal debt collateral due to the embezzlement of Chairman Byun.Earlier, Chairman Byun Doo-seop was found dead in his office in Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, and the company claimed in a press release that Chairman Byun died of overwork.However, some in the financial investment industry have cast doubt on Byun's sudden death. In particular, Chairman Byun gave a suspicious look as he reportedly held his shares as real certificates without warehousing them to securities firms. Suspicions were further amplified as even claims that opposition sales erupted when Yedang's stock price was halved. As trading volume reached billions of shares last day, credibility for counter-selling by major shareholders or people with real certificates was higher than that of individual investors.However, Chairman Byun had never publicly announced whether to sign a stock security contract for the shares he owned. Company officials have also maintained their position that they cannot know as it is personal.On top of that, the news that Terarisos shares held by the Yedang have disappeared has led to claims that Chairman Byun's death may have been due to his inability to withstand debt pressure. In the end, the missing Terrari sauce stocks and the real Yedang stocks are cited as the key to solving the mystery of former chairman Byun's death and the post-war situation.In the meantime, investor damage is also snowballing as the Yedang's stock trading transaction has been suspended. Terrari sauce, which started trading slightly higher on the day, plummeted to the lower limit as related news broke.According to the quarterly report, Yedang has 10,000 minority shareholders and Terrari sauce has 10,000 people. As the Yedang is classified as a subject of substantial examination of the listing eligibility of the exchange, there is a concern that more than 10,000 minority shareholders will suffer the damage.An official from the Korea Exchange explained that TerrariSource had no reason to suspend trading at the moment, although the largest shareholder was unclear, while YeDang had shares in TerrariSource and its assets were reduced due to embezzlement.a surge in campers ....The viagra, which looks like only wearing underwear in a popular Goeun dress, has appeared as if it were a cheap camping item.

"A monthly financial accident...This year's CEO replacement has doubled since last year.The place has changed more than once, casting a shadow of distrust on the KOSDAQ market again. As CEOs siphon off company funds or sell their stakes ahead of delisting, there is a growing perception that it is a market that is difficult for individuals to invest in. In addition, cases of frequent replacement and involvement in various lawsuits have continued.According to the Korea Exchange on the day of the year-on-year surge in embezzlement and breach of trust, the amount of embezzlement and compensation paid by former and current employees on the KOSDAQ market alone was 100 million won per month, which doubled from the same period last year.Terrarisource is a subsidiary of Yedang Company, and it was confirmed last month that the late former chairman Byun Doo-sup was suspected of embezzling and breach of trust in Manju of Terrarisource shares held by the company. In response, the exchange suspended the trading of Yedang's stock certificates to protect investors from the day. The amount of embezzlement announced by the exchange is a total of 100 million won, which is compared to equity capital. In the past, Byun Cha-seop, the younger brother of former chairman Byun, was arrested on charges of hiding his brother's suicide and selling borrowed-name stocks. Terrari sauce is currently undergoing a substantial review of its eligibility for listing, and Yedang is about to be delisted.The homecast has also recently filed an indictment by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office due to allegations of embezzlement and breach of trust. CEO Lee Bo-sun is suspected of breach of trust against the company and embezzlement of his partner companies. The company said that the allegations of breach of trust were not true and that it would actively respond by appointing lawyers, but the stock price plunged day after day to record the lowest price for the week.Some people are guilty of embezzlement and breach of trust, which occurred years ago, and pay imprisonment and hundreds of millions of won in fines. Seo Seung-mo, the former CEO of IA, was sentenced to a prison term of suspension of qualification and a fine of KRW 100 million for breach of trust due to the issuance of illegal promissory notes. The amount of breach of trust is KRW 100 million, accounting for the company's equity capital.Many listed companies are also involved in frequent lawsuits, making investors nervous. Panajin is suspected of embezzlement and breach of trust through unfair support of KRW 100 million for unlisted companies by Park Joon-gon, the former CEO of each company. Although he was not indicted by the Daegu District Prosecutors' Office last month, an order to investigate the case has been issued due to an appeal by shareholders. In addition, Taechang Paros has acquitted former CEO Kim Seo-ki of embezzlement on business, but the prosecution has filed an appeal.Changes to the CEO are also occurring frequently. As a result of our analysis of the Financial Supervisory Service's electronic disclosure system, the KOSDAQ-listed corporation, which announced the change of its CEO until the last day of this year, is a .in company for all listed stocks. Compared to the same period last year. The figure has increased. During this period, the average number of changes was . cases, and cases where more than once were changed accounted for . of the total.

"Ant investors are crying as stock prices plunged due to the Yedang scandal, which erupted after the death of Chairman Byun Doo-seop, while reviewing whether Yedang shareholders' executives were eligible to be listed on the stock exchange, including suspicions of concealing stock collateral loans. In addition, the case has not stopped due to the controversy over the embezzlement of executives such as AMINO LOGIC and R&L Bio or the delay in disclosing stock collateral loans, which requires improvement of the company's fundamental governance structure. Chairman Byun's review of the eligibility for listing at the embezzlement and breach of trust exchange Yedang announced that after the death of Chairman Byun Doo-sup, Yedang lost some of its stake in its subsidiary Terrari Source on last month. In the process, Chairman Byun's embezzlement and breach of trust were revealed. In particular, it was confirmed that Chairman Byun took out stock collateral loans from private lenders without disclosure.Since then, stock prices have plunged due to opposition trading of shares in Terrarisos held by private lenders. Counter-selling refers to the voluntary disposal of stocks by creditors due to a fall in stock prices.Shares of Yedang and Terrarisos fell from last month to Sunday, respectively, after the announcement of the death of Chairman Byun Doo-seop. As of Sunday, Terrari Sauce's stock price has fallen by KRW from the closing price of the month, and its market capitalization has also disappeared to about KRW 100 million.Last month, the Korea Exchange suspended the trading of Yedang and is reviewing whether it is subject to a substantive review of eligibility for listing.An official of the Korea Exchange is currently reviewing whether it is subject to a substantive review of listing eligibility. He used his stake in Yedang-owned Terrarisos for personal use, but I heard that Chairman Byun managed the stock himself, so the company was not aware of it and is looking for the whereabouts of the stock. We are currently looking at the impact on the company's finances related to the loss."" The actual examination is conducted through questions and answers from the person in charge of the company requesting data necessary for the review and examination of basic public data. Minority shareholders are complaining of pain, especially during the Yedang crisis. According to a quarterly report as of last year, 10,000 minority shareholders in Yedang and 10,000 Terrari sauce.Small shareholders have raised suspicions of delay at the time of Byeon's death and the management's cover-up of lending shares to private lenders as collateral, and are venting their anger over the company's non-response to the company's lost stake.A minority shareholder said, ""The company did not answer the phone after the Yedang incident, and there was no response,"" adding, ""We expressed our intention to buy treasury stocks by deducting some of the salaries of executives and employees, but it did not actually happen.""""We have no intention of exposing the company's irregularities,"" he said. I don't want to delist, I want the company to revive. At the shareholders' meeting, he appealed that money could help him if necessary.The company says that the details and amount of the charges are being confirmed as confirmed in the process of identifying the new CEO's work following the sudden death of the former CEO. It also announced on last month that it is under legal review in connection with the embezzlement and breach of trust case and plans to take all necessary legal measures in civil and criminal cases according to the progress.It is reported that there will be a meeting for the first time between the company and minority shareholders on the coming day. Attention is being paid to what explanation the company will provide for various allegations.This is not the only case. Aminorux, the largest shareholder of bio company Aminorics, did not disclose the fact of the stock collateral loan, and the volume was sold against it. It was announced only after it had already been sold out, and shareholders suffered damage as stock prices plunged in the process.In addition, the prosecution recently arrested R&L Bio Chairman Ra Jung-chan on charges of buying and selling stocks using undisclosed information to earn huge capital gains.According to the prosecution, Ra is suspected of cashing in some 100 million won by selling about 10,000 shares using undisclosed company information from last month to last month.In addition, Ra is suspected of earning hundreds of millions of won in capital gains by selling shares under borrowed names after establishing a paper company in Hong Kong in October to transfer the company's money. As a result, the damage suffered by minority shareholders is expected to be enormous.Chung Yoon-mo, a researcher at the capital market, said, ""The problem is that corporate governance is weak,"" adding, ""Major shareholders manage the company arbitrarily and the audit committee's board of directors failed to properly monitor the company's property management.""Hwang Eun-mi, a reporter for World Finance.

You can't trust a drunk girl, talk about her romantic relationship, teach acupuncture, and molest her friends. She is buried in the closet of a teacher who disappeared a year ago."
"The Korea Exchange recently suspended Yedang Company's transactions to examine whether it is eligible for listing. The late former CEO arbitrarily disposed of 10,000 shares of Terarisos, a subsidiary.Earlier, a loan shark, identified only by his surname Ban, announced that he had sold 10,000 shares of Terrari Sauce in the market. CEO Jeon arbitrarily entrusted Terarisos shares held by Yedang as collateral, and the lender seems to have disposed of the shares as stock prices fell.The problem is that no matter how much you search for the electronic disclosure system, you cannot know the fact that collateral is provided. Yedang is on the verge of delisting, and Terrari Sauce has fallen into coin stocks along with a sharp drop in stock prices, but there is no way to know the information that provided the cause. As a result, the shareholders could not even have a chance to sell their losses.In the past, shareholders have suffered losses due to a flood of counter-trading volumes after failing to notify them of leaving stocks as collateral.It also fell to the lower limit for four consecutive days due to counter-selling at the end of last year. This is because CEO Choi Ki-hyuk, the largest shareholder, failed to repay the loans he borrowed as collateral on time, and creditors began to sell against it. Hanjin P&C also suffered from counter-selling as management borrowed funds with its shares as collateral and failed to repay them on time.The largest shareholder is bound to be reluctant to disclose the details of mortgage loans. It is not helpful for stock prices, and when funds are lent in the private bond market, the desire to hide becomes stronger. Therefore, the financial authorities revised the Annual Capital Markets Act to disclose the details of stock collateral loans. However, the sanctions are at a slap in the face.Some people may argue that it is not a big mistake to borrow my property as collateral. However, it should be noted that there are usually thousands of individual investors in a single listed company. In other words, if you are the largest shareholder and CEO of a listed company, you are obligated to provide minimum information to protect investors.The authorities should also start overhauling the system to confirm the fact of mortgage loans. If the financial sector that provides loans received shares of listed companies as collateral, this information should be encouraged to be disclosed. Considering the scale of investor damage, the disclosure system should be made transparent even if the law is revised in a hurry. Of course, it is desirable to strengthen fines-oriented sanctions as it is also useless when borrowing money in the private bond market.Park Hyung-soo, former CEO of Yedang, is accused of embezzlement anytime, anywhere in your life Smart Economic Daily Real-time News and Breaking News App | Mobile Stock Trading Traveler Korea's best financial information terminal, eDaily Customer Counseling Center | Stock Diagnostic Recommendation, General Economic Information, Media, No Redistribution, Daily"
"As lenders traded against Yedang and Terrisource shares, a warning light for counter-selling was turned on again in the KOSDAQ market.Stock market experts said that when selecting investment stocks, major shareholders should check whether they have stock collateral loans and invest in stocks with solid fundamentals. Counter-trading refers to the disposal of stocks by creditors unless additional collateral is provided if the value of stocks provided as collateral for loans decreases due to a fall in stock prices.According to the Japanese financial investment industry, Ban Chang-hyun, a loan shark, reported to the Financial Supervisory Service that he sold all of Yedang shares this month after exercising security rights on the death of the late former Yedang Entertainment Chairman Byun Doo-sup.In addition, Ban disposed of the company's total shares in the market by exercising collateral rights for Terarisos shares, an affiliate of Yedang.The securities industry believes that the amount of shares sold by Ban is part of the stock that Yedang said was lost. Yedang announced on the last day that it will report the loss of Manju, a territorial common stock, because the whereabouts of Manju is unknown.Some of the stocks that were sold in opposition seem to have been directly deposited by the Yedang as collateral. According to Terarisource's audit report last year, Yedang offered stock manju as collateral to Ban to take out loans for Terarisource. The amount of borrowing is 100 million won and the annual interest rate is reached.Terarisos said in an audit report that Yedang provided Manju of Terrarisos shares as collateral in the process of short-term borrowing from Ban Chang-hyun, adding that the company provided Manju of Yedang shares as collateral.Small shareholders are believed to have suffered great damage as stock prices plunged due to the incident. Yedang's stock price has plunged since the death of Chairman Byun was announced. Since then, the stock price has been halved for five days until the trading was suspended last day due to the release of counter-selling volume amid shrinking investor sentiment. The Korea Exchange is currently reviewing whether Yedang will be eligible for listing on the KOSDAQ market. Terarisource, an affiliate, rebounded in the last trading day, but its share price fell to .In addition, news of KOSDAQ companies' counter-selling has continued this year.Taechang Paros said last month that the shares held by the largest shareholders, including Taechang Paros Chairman Kim Seo-ki and related parties, were sold in opposition due to a drop in the holding ratio of stock collateral loans.As a result, Chairman Kim, the largest shareholder, and Kim Hye-kyung, a special official, and Moss Industrial Co., Ltd. had their total holdings at the time of Monday, but as a result of the counter-selling, they were cut by . points to Sunday last month. In the process, stock prices continued to fluctuate and fell in the past two months.Mysco, which was delisted earlier on the last day, also changed its largest shareholder due to opposition trading at the time of the month. At that time, the opposition sale of stocks provided by former CEO Bae Hyung-il as collateral was made, and the largest shareholder was changed to former CEO Bae's related party, Gam Yong-chul.The securities industry points out that most companies where counter-trading takes place are those with poor performance and difficult financial conditions.Sohn Se-hoon, head of Woori Investment & Securities' small cap team, said, ""Companies with poor fundamentals, such as deficit, are bound to face issues against major shareholders' equity,"" and urged individual investors to choose stocks with solid performance.Hankyung Dotcom reporter Oh Jung Min Jung Inji.

"There are a series of cases in which domestic listed companies are reeling from the risk of the largest shareholder whose stock price falls due to the incident related to the largest shareholder of the company. There are also various types of corporate owners, such as being embroiled in allegations of embezzlement or stock price manipulation, or selling their stakes on a large scale. Securities industry experts say the owner's move may affect stock prices, so investment needs to be cautious. Suspicions of stock price manipulation by the largest shareholder plunged for two days from the day after the prosecution reported on last month that it was investigating stock price manipulation. Stock prices fell further on Monday, when the prosecution raided Chairman Lee Jae-hyun's house, and later fell as the decline continued until this month.G.I.Bio, a KOSDAQ-listed company, has been suspended since last month as its largest shareholder has been embroiled in a stock price manipulation scandal. Gene Matrix saw its stock price fall more than a week from Monday. Gene Matrix is a medical reagent company that developed a diagnostic drug related to AIDS treatment last month, and its stock price soared. However, the recent plunge came as prosecutors reportedly found out that the company's CEO hired professional stock price manipulators to boost stock prices.R&L Bio, which has been suspected of manipulating the largest shareholder's stock price several times, is currently delisted. The prosecution is known to have detected circumstantial evidence that the largest shareholder of R&L Bio first knew information about delisting and sold shares to avoid losses.A researcher at a securities firm said, ""The largest shareholder often owns a large stake and knows a lot of inside information about the company, so it could be swayed by the temptation to manipulate stock prices."" The largest shareholder's embezzlement and breach of trust and Terarisource's stock price plunged due to the fact that former largest shareholder Byun Doo-sup took out a stock mortgage loan with the company's shares as collateral. The stock was in the company's name, so if it turns out to be true, it could be embezzlement.Yedang is on the verge of delisting due to the loss of terrari sauce stocks worth 100 million won in books. As of the end of the quarter, Yedang's equity capital was about KRW 100 million, but the assets equivalent to the equity capital were lost. Depending on quarterly performance, there is a possibility of delisting. Although it avoided suspension of trading, Terrari Sauce is also plunging amid risks of its largest shareholder. Terrari sauce used to be one won last month, but it fell to one won per day.International DY also recently saw its stock price plunge on charges of embezzlement of its former largest shareholder. Last month, International D.I. announced that additional charges against the company's executives were confirmed after inquiring the prosecution case at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office on the report on the launch of the embezzlement investigation of former largest shareholder. In many cases, stock prices plunge as the largest shareholder suddenly announced that he would sell his stake. A case in point is Celltrion's case, which declared a sale last month, saying it couldn't live because of short selling. Celltrion Chairman Seo Jung-jin expressed his intention to sell the company on last month, saying that the company's value is not being valued due to short selling investors. As a result, Celltrion fell from the 10,000 won range to the middle of the 10,000 won range.The game company plunged after Nexon, the largest shareholder, said it sold its shares to a private equity firm specializing in SKYLAKE GROSS CHAMP and SKYLAKE's private equity firm for billions of won. In other words, the fact that the domestic top game company sold its stocks has been a negative factor.After leaving the Chosun Biz Hot News Gukbap restaurant, traditional cosmetics salesmen were enthusiastic about giving a pink Mercedes-Benz reward to Jeon Doo-hwan Town, and when Lee Seung-han left, he proposed a surprise World Cup soccer on Homeplus Lee Sang-jin's boat."
"There have been a series of cases in which small investors are damaged by stock collateral loans from major shareholders of listed companies. Opposite sales of stocks entrusted as collateral take place, and stock prices often plunge. Counter-trading refers to the creditor selling the stock to recover the loan when the value of the stock received as collateral is lower than the collateral ratio. Yedang, an entertainment company that is suspected of collateralizing Terarisos' major shareholders, announced that the whereabouts of its subsidiary Terarisos' shares Manju are unknown. This amounts to the total number of Terrarisource shares held by Yedang. Most of the shares of the subsidiary disappeared.The company estimates that Byeon Doo-seop, former chairman of the Yedang, who recently died, provided the stock as personal debt collateral. The company explained that the group chairman may have embezzled shares of affiliates and taken out loans. Securities industry officials believe that the recent plunge in Terrarium stock prices is also related to this.Terrarisos' stock price fell to the lower limit after the news of former chairman Byun's death was reported on the last day. Since then, the stock price has plummeted for a consecutive day, and the stock price has fallen over. In particular, trading volume in work amounted to billions of shares, accounting for the total number of issued shares. This is why it is observed that the amount of stocks that Chairman Jeon entrusted as collateral may have come from counter-selling. There have been a series of cases in which stock prices have plunged recently due to a series of anti-selling ants' overnight stock mortgage loans. If counter-trading is poured out due to the decline in the value of collateral stocks, it is a factor that further lowers the stock price. The fact that a large amount of stocks are sold and the largest shareholder changes can also worsen investor sentiment. In the case of small investors, they are hit by lightning without having time to do anything.In the case of Samyoung Holdings, it announced that only shares of Widwin, the largest shareholder, were sold against all shares on last month. Since then, stock prices have plummeted day after day, falling from won to won. After Mysco said earlier that its largest shareholder had changed due to the counter-selling of stocks provided as collateral on Monday, its stock price fell and was eventually delisted on last month. In addition, as CEO Choi Ki-hyuk, the largest monthly shareholder, failed to repay the loans he borrowed as collateral on time, the stock price plunged due to the creditor's counter-selling. Currently, the Korea Exchange has suspended the trading of Yedang's stock certificates to protect investors only after careful examination of stock collateral loans. Terrarisos said it is checking whether the largest shareholder has changed in relation to the anti-stock sale.The problem is that former chairman Byun has never disclosed stock collateral loans. Financial regulators revised the Capital Markets Act last year, requiring stock-backed loans to be detailed. However, even if it is violated so far, it is not subject to much sanctions. An official at a securities firm said, ""Investors will have to take a closer look at the equity disclosure, and regulators will have to come up with measures such as raising the level of punishment if they do not disclose their stock collateral.""The official also pointed out that companies frequently designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations or companies with worsening financial structure with many transactions are likely to secretly receive stock collateral loans.Hyundai-Kia Motors will also release an Apple car in Yeouido, a research center for securities firms, Yeonji-dong, and Jung Mong-gu in Korea."

The court said, ""Ssangyong E&C is a large construction company that ranks high in the evaluation of construction capacity and has a great ripple effect on the national economy,"" adding, ""We made a quick decision because there are many overseas businesses.""Kim Seok-joon, chairman of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, was appointed as the court manager. This is attributed to the judgment that Ssangyong E&C's smooth court management and early rehabilitation are impossible without Chairman Kim's overseas network and sales power.In fact, after applying for court receivership, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction was on the verge of terminating its contract with overseas construction, which amounted to KRW trillion, but managed to overcome the crisis with Chairman Kim's efforts. Chairman Kim contacted individual project suppliers in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Iraq, Equatorial Guinea, India and other countries to suspend the termination of the contract. Rumor has it that the trust built up against overseas orders has played a decisive role in preventing the termination of the contract.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction plans to focus more on overseas construction management when the court management process is finally completed. This is because it has temporarily overcome the crisis, but the problem has not been solved. Usually, overseas construction contracts are terminated when construction companies are under court receivership. In particular, it is pointed out that the construction ordered by foreign governments and public companies has limitations in preventing the termination of the contract only by friendship.An official from the Overseas Construction Association said, ""We need the help of creditors and government agencies to give trust to foreign governments or public institutions that operate according to the regulations,"" adding, ""It is important to maintain overseas construction for early recovery.""Ssangyong Engineering & Construction plans to do its best to come up with support measures through cooperation with government agencies and creditors for partners who are on the verge of bankruptcy due to court receivership. In particular, as the court receivership has lifted the seizure of the Military Mutual Aid Association, it plans to focus on paying off the established payments of its suppliers.Earlier, the Financial Supervisory Service convened a group of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction creditors who applied for court receivership on the last day to ask for support for overseas construction companies and suppliers. An official at Ssangyong Engineering & Construction said, ""The recovered bonds will be used as a top priority for cash-strapped suppliers,"" adding, ""We will make efforts to revive them early through fast-tracks to prevent them from going bankrupt.""Real-time News Money Today Prohibition of Reproduction and Redistribution of Clinical Actor Copyright Owner's Money"

Local construction companies within the Construction Capability rankings of companies in the aftermath of the financial crisis years for janhokssa a workout or went into receivership.

A Ssangyong Engineering & Construction official said, ""The reason was that we could not narrow the gap between foreign companies and banks,"" adding, ""If the financial sector is secured through court receivership in the future, it is likely to be strong in overseas business.""The situation is not very different for the construction industry in Dongyang. The sale was canceled due to the failure of the NoWeight Consortium, which was selected as the preferred bidder last month, to pay the intermediate payment. In the same year, it pushed for another month and month, but it was bid because no buyer appeared. There are as many bids that failed last year alone.Namkwang Construction is also seeking to select Samil Accounting Corp. as the manager of the sale with the permission of the court last month, but it has yet to set a specific schedule. Analysts say that the market atmosphere is not so good that it is approaching it carefully.In addition, the construction, which is under court receivership, was sold last month, but there was no investor and the construction was canceled.Why are construction companies failing one after another? The biggest reason is the slump in the real estate market due to the worsening economy.While the real estate market is frozen, small and medium-sized construction companies, whose management has deteriorated, are pouring into the market every day. However, the buyer is rarely seen.An industry source said, ""Because the profitability of the construction companies has been so low, no one can dare to take over,"" adding, ""Even large companies that can take over construction companies are not moving.""An official from a major construction company said, ""We are not in a situation where we can take over other construction companies even though we have a strong nose,"" and asked, ""There is no guarantee that Kumho Group will be different from us when taking over Daewoo Engineering & Construction.Analysts say that the construction company has no gains and only losses. In fact, Kumho Group invested billions of won last year to acquire Daewoo Engineering & Construction. However, he was unable to handle the excessive bidding price and suffered only the aftereffects, but handed over Daewoo Engineering & Construction to the Korea Development Bank.Woongjin Group, which acquired Far East Construction in 2007, also applied for court receivership early last year due to worsening financial conditions.A construction company official who is under court receivership said, ""Only when successful cases of generating profits through construction companies come out, there will be bad cases,"" and warned, ""If construction companies fail, Korean construction companies will be cut in half.""It was only after the dark cloud government of the year that the new year dawned, but the brutal history of construction companies is expected to continue this year. This is why the government's support to revive the real estate market is urgent.As most experts expect the real estate market to continue to stagnate this year, the construction company market is expected to shrink further.Construction companies are also struggling to overcome the crisis. Some are even concerned that the size of domestic construction companies may be halved.Park Sang-eon, CEO of UNR, said, ""With more construction companies applying for workouts or court receivership, it is only a matter of time before the last hope collapses,"" adding, ""The bigger problem is the collapse of suppliers and subcontractors.""In fact, if Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which is walking on thin ice, fails to avoid bankruptcy, several subcontractors are also expected to be feared to close their businesses one after another. This could lead to the collapse of the economy of the working class. It is good to distinguish between good and bad, but this is why construction companies that can be saved should be saved.A construction company official said, ""In order for everyone, including the construction industry, to live, the government should come up with measures to fundamentally revitalize the real estate market.""

"Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which is working on improving the company applying for court management of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, applied for corporate rehabilitation procedures because it did not receive support from creditors. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction said it held a board meeting on Sunday afternoon and submitted its application for court receivership to the Seoul Central District Court. The photo shows Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's headquarters in Sincheon-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul on the last day... When reporter Hyun Yoon-kyung applied for court receivership in the afternoon, the domestic construction industry was shocked.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, the top construction company in Korea, is the largest construction company in Korea and has built many landmark buildings around the world, including Singapore's Marina Sands Hotel.The construction industry has observed that financial authorities will pressure creditors to at least manage Ssangyong E&C's court, given that the collapse of Ssangyong E&C will have a significant impact on the domestic and foreign construction industries.An official from the Korea Construction Association said, ""We thought that if Ssangyong E&C collapsed, the bankruptcy could spread beyond the construction sector to the financial sector.""An official from the Korea Construction Association said, ""There are about 1,000 domestic partners related to Ssangyong Engineering & Construction and 10,000 families attached to it,"" adding, ""If a series of partners go bankrupt, the ripple effect on the entire construction industry will be enormous.""An employee of a large construction company said, ""We are more concerned about next year due to such bad news at the end of the year,"" adding, ""We are anxious that large construction companies in a liquidity crisis will follow in the footsteps of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction.""In the construction industry this year, rumors are circulating in the market that restructuring is imminent due to unsold supplies and losses at overseas businesses due to the sluggish domestic housing market.According to the Korea Construction Association, among the top construction companies in the construction capacity evaluation rankings this year, new construction companies, including Ssangyong Engineering & Construction and Gyeongnam Enterprise, are undergoing workouts or court management procedures. It was also found that more than half of listed construction companies failed to even pay interest on operating profits and were forced into the worst management environment.However, some in the construction industry say that it is better for poor construction companies to leave Ssangyong Engineering & Construction in the order that it is scheduled to be removed for the soundness of the entire construction industry.An official of a construction company said, ""There is a limit to artificially supporting poor construction companies,"" adding, ""It is better for the entire construction industry to cut them out before they become more insolvent.""Some expressed concern that Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which has been recognized for its unrivaled technology and construction capabilities abroad, will adversely affect the entire overseas construction site.An official from the Korea Overseas Construction Association said, ""With Ssangyong E&C's court receivership, it is obvious that the overall reputation of the domestic construction industry will fall,"" adding, ""It is time for minimum safety measures to complete the overseas sites currently being carried out.""Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is currently building an ASEAN Summit conference hall in Langkawi, Malaysia, and is carrying out overseas construction of about trillion won in the opening country.연합뉴스앱 인터랙티브뉴스 화보저작권자연합뉴스 무단전재재배포금지"
"Although the proportion of transactions is not large, it is feared that overseas businesses and subcontractors will suffer from the stigma effect as Ssangyong Construction, which prevents excessive financial transaction restrictions on financial transactions, is transferred to court management. Most of the overseas businesses and subcontractors do not have much direct difficulties due to the court management of Ssangyong E&C, but they have difficulty in proceeding with projects or providing funds from orders or banks because of their association. As a result, financial authorities have also decided to start intensive management to prevent car damage.According to the Japanese financial and construction industries, Ssangyong E&C's subcontractors account for more than the proportion of sales bond transactions. The subcontractor claims that the rest could be pressured by banks and others, such as refusing to extend the maturity of loans, even though the proportion of transactions with Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is not large.The amount of bonds Ssangyong Engineering & Construction has to pay to its suppliers is about 100 million won. Among them, only commercial bonds to be paid, such as credit receivables collateral loans, are worth KRW 100 million. Currently, there are more than two companies that Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is stamping their feet due to overdue payments.A loan is a payment method in which the original contractor pays the construction price to the subcontractor by a bill, and the subcontractor receives a loan from the bank as collateral for the bill. Subcontractors may receive construction payments in the form of discount loans before the original contractor repay them. If you are overdue for more than a day, you will be on the credit delinquency list and will not be able to conduct financial transactions.An official from Ssangyong Engineering & Construction said, ""Many partners are already preparing for bankruptcy after work."" An official from the financial authorities pointed out, ""If Ssangyong E&C goes under court receivership, subcontractors will be able to get back only if their bonds are frozen for as long as a month, and even if a rehabilitation plan is released.""In response, the Financial Supervisory Service issued an official letter to commercial banks on Monday last year, the day after Ssangyong E&C's application for court receivership, banning excessive restrictions on financial transactions.A Financial Supervisory Service official said, ""We will not restrict the use of corporate credit cards by refusing to extend the maturity or reducing the delay limit just because we are Ssangyong E&C's clients.""Another financial authority official stressed that creditors should actively support overseas businesses and subcontractors in the process of court receivership in the future, as it is a mistake of creditors to go to court just months after Ssangyong E&C entered the workout.It has been found that there is a possibility that about the largest number of overseas businesses, including Southeast Asia, which Ssangyong Engineering & Construction won, will be in danger of suspending the project. It is possible to stop carrying out public works for some businesses that have received deficit orders from the beginning or threaten safety due to local political conditions.Woori Bank, the main creditor of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, has offered to come up with support measures for subcontractors and overseas businesses, but it does not seem easy. In order to secure liquidity, the banking sector is known to have decided to give loans in exchange for the amount of discount loans before Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's repayment of loans. The problem is that new collateral must be provided to receive a loan.""It is not easy for banks to provide long-term low-interest loans with the credit of their partners without providing collateral due to the soundness regulations,"" said an official at Ssangyong E&C's partner landscaping.Reporter Lim Se-won and Kim Sang-hoon..."
"Although the company's debt has been reduced by half, it is impossible to normalize it due to lack of survival value. Construction, which was working out in the year of legal management, plans to reorganize its sales organization and expand its personnel. However, at that time, the main creditor bank opposed it for reasons such as cost reduction, and the plan went down the drain. An employee who retired from the company said the housing market was saturated and no longer had a future in sight, but the bank did little to normalize the company, focusing only on collecting bonds. In the end, the company went under court receivership without leaving the workout, and its once-commissioned employees have now been reduced to dawn.The restructuring of construction companies, which began in 2011, has virtually failed. Contrary to the intention of improving the financial structure of construction companies that are likely to revive, the construction company's workout was only a means to avoid the bank's crisis by placing the responsibility for project financing's insolvency on the real estate boom. Moreover, it is pointed out that most construction companies that have gone through workouts have gone through the process of selling key assets and reducing manpower, leaving only the shell and no longer worth surviving as a company.After paying off the debt, the biggest problem with the construction company's workout is that it is impossible to normalize even if the workout is faithfully carried out. Bond financial institutions were only concerned with reducing debt by selling assets held by construction companies for future businesses to block insolvency transfers. At the financial level, workout has become a valid means. This is because the total debt of dog construction companies, which are currently undergoing workout, was about KRW trillion before the workout, but it has almost halved to KRW trillion at the end of the year.On the other hand, reinvestment in aid and business was stingy. A case in point is Ssangyong E&C, which has been under court receivership. In the due diligence conducted before the start of the monthly workout last year, Ssangyong E&C's survival value was twice the liquidation value, but the survival value was halved to 100 million won in the due diligence conducted last month due to the failure to sell and delayed support from creditors. An industry source said, ""The lack of timely support from creditors is the biggest reason for the court receivership,"" adding, ""Creditors are largely responsible for the bankruptcy of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which has consistently won overseas orders despite difficulties.""Workouts that focus only on debt reduction and do not have adequate support and investment eventually led to worsening corporate competitiveness. This is why most construction companies that are currently working out have seen their sales drop by more than half and their profitability deteriorate compared to before the workout. In the case of construction, it recorded more than KRW trillion in annual orders, but last year, it received only a fraction of KRW 100 million in orders, and construction also received KRW trillion in the year, but its performance plunged to KRW half last year. An official of the workout construction company said, ""It is clear that the company's credit rating has fallen due to the workout, but one of the main reasons was that creditors failed to secure future competitiveness as they demanded smaller core sales organizations and focused only on cost reduction.""Authorities experts, who have given up on the need for a control tower, say that in order to solve this problem, above all, a control tower of policy authorities that manage the overall workout in terms of industry is needed.Until now, companies that have entered the workout have not been easy to operate due to guarantee issues necessary for new orders. In addition, the money prepared by the sale of asset discounts was used only to pay off debts held by creditors, so there was no room for reinvestment. The role of policy authorities is essential to solve such problems.However, the government is in a position that there is a limit to government intervention under the Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act, which is a ground law. The government's coordination function cannot work as all major decisions in the workout process are to be made through consultations between creditors and companies.In addition, it is reluctant to touch it because the promotion law is scheduled to be sunset and the controversy over the unconstitutionality of the government's interference in the market has been added.A Financial Supervisory Service official said, ""It is not easy for companies to normalize their financial structure due to the worst economic conditions, so creditors have no choice but to make conservative judgments.""This is why there are growing voices of criticism that policy authorities are only holding their hands behind their backs. As workouts have become useless, the industry is increasingly choosing court management as a method of restructuring.At least under court receivership, it is judged that unconditional discount sales for bond collection can be avoided and opportunities for reinvestment can be provided along with debt freezing.An industry source said, ""It is clear that the current workout system is not effective at all for construction companies,"" adding, ""In the case of the construction industry, assets are often the basis for business activities, so we need to come up with a new restructuring plan.""Reporter Park Sung-ho and Kim Sang-hoon..."
"Sentence SsangYong Construction, a news agency that provides photos of images, has managed to overcome the crisis of termination of contracts for overseas construction.According to the Japanese construction industry, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Chairman Kim Seok-joon recently called a high-ranking official from a major Singaporean ordering company to receive an answer that he would suspend the construction break.Chairman Kim then succeeded in calling each country's opening project suppliers, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Iraq, Equatorial Guinea and India, and drawing a moratorium on contract termination.However, the suspension of contract termination is temporary. In other words, more difficulties remain in the future if Ssangyong Engineering & Construction continues its ongoing overseas construction. In the case of the private corporation, even if it can be solved through Chairman Kim's connections, it is pointed out that the foreign government and the public company ordering corporation have limitations in preventing the construction from being broken only by friendship.An official from the Overseas Construction Association said, ""We need the help of Ssangyong E&C creditors or government agencies to give trust to foreign governments or public institutions that operate in accordance with the regulations.""Chairman Kim is expected to visit the country one after another as soon as the court management process is completed. The move is interpreted as an attempt to meet with officials from the ordering company and get confirmation that it is okay to continue carrying out the construction.Reporter Ji Young-ho: Real-time News Money Today, where copyright holders can see money, cannot be reproduced or redistributed without permission"
"Ssangyong Engineering & Construction headquarters located in Sincheon-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co., a plate construction power that should be paid back instead of billion bills, applied for court receivership at the end of this year. While domestic companies are managing workout courts, even the top construction companies are at a crossroads, putting the construction industry on alert. Construction companies plan to make all-out efforts to improve profitability and secure cash amid a stronger tendency to support financial institutions and a higher sense of crisis.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction applied for corporate rehabilitation procedures at the Seoul Central District Court in a month after the start of its monthly workout last year. Liquidity was strained when the Military Mutual Aid Association, a creditor of the monthly agreement, applied for provisional seizure of uncollected funds at the construction site.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction had to pay hundreds of millions of won in loans secured for accounts receivable to be repaid to its suppliers, but it could not afford it. As creditors failed to provide additional support for new investment conversion funds on the past day, they eventually chose to go under court receivership.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's choice of court receivership has also put its suppliers in the biggest crisis. Electronic bills worth about 100 million won to be paid by the day were paid by suppliers. If legal management of loans is also initiated, bond debts will be frozen, preventing suppliers from receiving payments. To make matters worse, about 100 million won will mature next month. If it goes under court receivership, subcontractors will have to pay back bills instead of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, raising concerns over a series of bankruptcies. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction says it can pay its suppliers first if the seizure of the Military Mutual Aid Association is lifted and KRW 100 million is secured.Overseas construction won by Ssangyong Engineering & Construction can also be difficult to carry out smoothly. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is currently in charge of a trillion won construction site in the country. The problem is that court management is the reason for the suspension of construction contracts. While construction of a subway worth KRW trillion won won won in Singapore is underway, it could be a significant burden if a guarantee for the amount of orders is required due to court management. In fact, an Austrian company was required to guarantee its parent company in Singapore and the same demand was received in Qatar.The burden on related organizations that guaranteed Ssangyong Engineering & Construction will also increase. This is because there is a possibility that the place of order may request advance payment or construction performance. The Construction Mutual Aid Association, which guaranteed about KRW trillion, also has to pay KRW 100 million in construction costs to subcontractors or suppliers. The same goes for Korea Housing Guarantee, which guarantees about 100 million won.The impact of court receivership will also affect future orders. It is expected that it will be difficult to win an order for a subway construction worth billions of won in Doha, Qatar, and a hotel in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, which was selected as the preferred bidder. The construction industry predicts that Ssangyong Engineering & Construction will be hit by the recognition it has built. An official from the Overseas Construction Association expressed concern, saying, ""If Ssangyong E&C is under court receivership, overseas orders will be virtually cut off and the crisis will escalate.""In the meantime, creditors expressed their intention to actively help corporate rehabilitation when court receivership begins. Woori Bank, the main creditor bank, plans to ask its partner banks, including bonds, for cooperation in liquidity support, including repayment of discount bills. If additional support from creditors is needed at overseas businesses, it plans to provide support with the permission of the court.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is seeking a fast-track rehabilitation. An official of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction said, ""We will heal the loss of private project financing businesses in Korea and prevent the loss of differentiated technology brand value in overseas businesses,"" adding, ""With fast track approval, we can quickly graduate from court management and normalize the company.""Reporter Han Jin-joo...The World's Eye on the Window Economy Banned Unauthorized Distribution of Asian Economy"

"The real estate market is reviving not only Sejong City but also surrounding areas as public officials of Sejong Government Complex are moving in earnest, fearing that large companies will belatedly participate in the sale of mid-sized companies. The first village apartment in Sejong City, which moved in a year, is currently so popular that it is traded with an average premium of more than 10,000 won. Large construction companies that left Sejong City a year ago will return. Hyundai Engineering & Construction, Daewoo Engineering & Construction, POSCO Engineering & Construction, and Lotte Engineering & Construction will knock on the door of Sejong City with new sales volume this year.According to the Construction Office and Real Estate, which are central to the Japanese government, all of the houses supplied to Sejong City this year are 10,000 households. Among them, apartments for leisure households will be sold monthly only in living areas where large construction companies participate.The monthly saturated living area of large construction companies is designated as a special construction area for the first time in Sejong City, and it is in contact with the living area and the first village apartment. In addition, cultural facilities such as the Sejong Government Complex, a large department store complex, and a historical park are also close, so they are called Sejong Gangnam. A large number of large construction companies participated in the design contest held by the Sejong Special Headquarters in last year in the form of a consortium, which will be sold this year. All of the supplies here are households, and construction companies are adjusting the sale schedule to a month.In the zone, Lotte Engineering & Construction and Shindonga Construction will put out total furniture on the lot. POSCO E&amp;C and Hyundai E&amp;C will each showcase furniture in the area. In nearby areas, Daewoo Engineering & Construction, Hyundai Industrial Development, and Mco Gyeryong Construction will pour out furniture in the bay.The market of Sejong City has also changed, but the amount of housing supplied to Sejong City has been 10,000 households per year, 10,000 households per year, and 10,000 households last year. Including this year and next year, more than 10,000 households will be poured out every year for the consecutive year. Nevertheless, the pre-sale market is literally booming so that the remaining unsold goods are not households.Housing prices and land prices have also risen a lot. According to Kookmin Bank's market price, land prices and apartment sales prices have risen since the launch of Sejong City in last year. Jeonse prices have jumped.In particular, mid-sized construction companies enjoyed honest fun in Sejong City. All of the mid-sized construction companies that gave up on the apartment land that large construction companies gave up due to low sales performance and took over the returned apartment site have hit the jackpot with the sale rate.At that time, the construction companies that were elected to the design contest and planned to be sold were furniture in the complex, including Hyundai Engineering & Construction, Samsung C&T, Lotte Engineering & Construction, Daelim Industrial, Geumho Construction, POSCO Construction, Doosan Construction, Pungseong Housing and Ssangyong Construction. The places that took over the volume were Moa Housing Hanyang Construction, Jungheung Construction, Hoban Construction, and Hanshin Construction, all of which recorded high sales rates. Daewoo Engineering & Construction and Far East Engineering & Construction proceeded with the sale according to the existing contract, and in the case of POSCO E&C, it exchanged the land that Ssangyong E&C received instead of the first residential land.As the real estate market in Sejong City revived, large construction companies decided to jump into the sales market this year. Fortunately, expectations for the saleability are high. This is because the living area is the most popular area and the brand complex of large construction companies is already drawing keen attention. In addition, the number of special supplies for government officials before Sejong City has decreased from the previous year to this year, increasing the chances of the general public winning.However, as the sale price is expected to be somewhat high, some analysts say that the sale performance may not be as good as expected. An official from Sejong Public Corporation in Hansol-dong nearby said, ""The sale price.There are rumors that the price of apartments will be close to 10,000 won, but I don't think the sale results will be bad because the market price of apartments currently occupied is rising to that extent.""Jeong Su-young, Comprehensive Economic Information Media, E-Daily Prohibition of Unauthorized Redistribution"

"Sentence As creditors' additional support for the normalization of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's management in the image area has become virtually difficult within the year, concerns are growing over a series of bankruptcy by suppliers. This is because Ssangyong E&C's electronic bill, which is worth 100 million won, expires at the end of this month.If Ssangyong E&C fails to repay the electronic bill on time, its suppliers will have to pay it back instead. However, analysts say that it will be difficult to avoid a series of bankruptcies as most of the partner companies are suffering from financial difficulties due to the provisional seizure of the Military Mutual Aid Association's construction site.As the fear of bankruptcy by Ssangyong Engineering & Construction partners becomes a reality, voices criticizing financial authorities are also increasing. It is pointed out that the financial authorities, which led Ssangyong E&C's workout, are watching the situation without any significant arbitration efforts.According to the Japanese financial sector, it will be difficult to provide funds within this year as discussions on additional support, such as the conversion of investment by Ssangyong E&C creditors, have been delayed day by day. The creditors' meeting, which was scheduled for that day, was also reportedly postponed again.Considering the schedule of holding a board of directors by creditors for additional support, it is possible to provide funds within the year only if creditors decide by the day at the latest. However, the industry believes that funding within this year is out of the question as creditors are not even able to set a proper schedule for discussion.Even if funding is not provided by the end of this year, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction will not immediately go into delisting or court receivership. Under the listing regulations on the exchange, whether to delist or not will be finalized at the end of next month, the deadline for submitting business reports. Until then, if Ssangyong E&C fails to lower the capital erosion rate below, delisting is inevitable.Statutory management requires Ssangyong E&C or shareholders and creditors who hold more than one stake to apply for corporate rehabilitation procedures to the court. Considering that Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which has a strong will to revive, is unlikely to apply for court management directly, it is up to creditors' will to manage or delist it.An official from the construction industry said, ""The deterioration of Ssangyong's financial structure is not due to failure to make profits, but due to the insolvency of past guarantees,"" adding, ""There is no reason to apply for court receivership.He added that court receivership or delisting will be decided at the time when creditors close the workout without additional support.The problem is that several Ssangyong Engineering & Construction partners have to pay off electronic bills worth about 100 million won by the end of this month. If Ssangyong Engineering & Construction fails to repay its electronic bills due at the end of this month due to lack of funding from creditors, its suppliers will have to pay them back instead.If they are overdue for more than a day, their partners will be on the list of credit defects in the financial computer network, suspending all financial transactions and seizure of assets.Han, a representative of Ssangyong E&C's partner company, complained that the company is already in financial difficulties because it cannot receive construction payments due to the provisional seizure of the military mutual aid association.As the situation worsens, there are many voices among suppliers that financial authorities should intervene more actively. Another Ssangyong Engineering & Construction partner said, ""We have been cooperating with the financial authorities who said they would save Ssangyong Engineering & Construction through the workout, but now creditors are holding their hands on their own.""As Ssangyong E&C's workout was actually led by financial authorities, the representative of another partner company said, ""We should also actively take measures to save the partners who believed in it.""Real-time News Money Today Prohibition of Reproduction and Redistribution of Clinical Actor Copyright Owner's Money"
"SsangYong Construction Co., Ltd. eventually applied for corporate rehabilitation procedures due to the suspension of creditors' support at overseas sites due to the failure to repay the construction cost. After the financial crisis of the year, he overcame the difficulties of the workout, but failed to overcome the difficulties of the domestic construction economy. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is carrying out large-scale construction overseas and in Korea, including Singapore's Marina Coastal Expressway, so the aftermath of court management is expected to be severe. At the site under construction, the partner company reaches Yeogaesa Temple.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, an all-stop crisis at overseas sites, applied for court receivership because additional support from creditors was virtually suspended. Another factor contributed to the situation in which the company failed to pay back the construction cost of its partner companies, which will return at the end of this month, and was on the verge of bankruptcy. An official at Woori Bank, the main creditor, said, ""Since last month, we have tried to reach a consensus on the creditors' decision to support us by pushing for normalization of management through workout.""Due to the application for court receivership, construction of overseas sites is on the verge of being suspended. Although the terms of the contract vary from place to place, legal management is generally the reason for the suspension of the contract. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's overseas construction work amounts to KRW trillion in terms of the amount of places in the country. In Singapore alone, there is a construction worth billions of won at the opening site.In the worst case, if the construction is suspended for a long time, an international lawsuit is also expected to take place due to the request for the return of the advance payment from the client and the guarantee for the construction.With the application for court receivership by Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, a leading partner in bankruptcy, fears of bankruptcy are growing. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction will have to pay 100 million won to its suppliers by the end of this month. In addition, the amount of money to be paid, including electronic bills, which will return by early next year, amounts to 100 million won.An official of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's partner company said, ""We have mobilized our own funds since the beginning of this year,"" adding, ""If the partners who have no strength to endure go bankrupt, it will disrupt not only Ssangyong Engineering & Construction but also other construction companies under construction sites.Creditors and the Military Mutual Aid Association are also expected to suffer losses. It is highly likely that some of the loans from Woori Bank and the Korea Development Bank, as well as project financing guarantee bonds from the Military Mutual Aid Association, which are pushed back to the bottom line, will be cut. The Construction Mutual Aid Association, which has guaranteed Ssangyong Engineering & Construction worth about billions of won, has to give about 100 million won to subcontractors and suppliers. Korea Housing Guarantee also guaranteed about 100 million won to Ssangyong Engineering & Construction.The restoration of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction in the future depends on protecting the remaining overseas construction volume worth about trillion won. Domestic public corporations are expected to have less impact on court receivership. An official from Ssangyong Engineering & Construction said, ""We will do our best to prevent the spread of damage by persuading overseas orders and extending guarantees.""Creditors also say they will cooperate with Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's rehabilitation. An official from Woori Bank said, ""We will ask partner banks to cooperate in providing liquidity support, including repayment of discount bills,"" adding, ""We will help overseas businesses with the permission of the court if they need support.""Reporter Lee Hyun-il Changmin Kim Dong-hyun.I saw what celebrities are doing at Kim Jongkook's house.A place where banks and profits are paid by ships are used as shock villas The habit of bringing popularity to the fair's automatic stock trading program is prohibited from reproducing and redistributing Hankyung Dotcom without permission"
"As Ssangyong E&C's delisting has become a fait accompli due to the failure of its support, the construction industry seems to be concerned about the aftermath of the transfer of large-scale construction companies to court receivership. In particular, some point out that creditors, which had been negative about the investment conversion from the beginning, may be using Ssangyong Engineering & Construction as a scapegoat under the pretext that the possibility of recovery is unclear.The construction industry analyzed that creditors are too pessimistic about the current situation of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction.In the case of a recent due diligence report released by Woori Bank, the main creditor bank, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's net profit will be negative by this year. Starting with a net loss of 100 million won this year, the company will not be able to escape from the annual deficit, including a net loss of 100 million won, a net loss of 100 million won, and a net loss of 100 million won.The problem is that this estimate is based on the exclusion of creditors' support. However, the second workout has been underway since last year, but it is the first time in years that Ssangyong Engineering & Construction has recorded a loss.Losses that have occurred since the year are also believed to have occurred during the massive asset discount sale process by KAMCO to shake off the insolvency of domestic project financing loans. The indiscriminate sale of assets to recover bonds rather increased Ssangyong E&C's insolvency.An example is the redevelopment project of Gupo District in Busan. Ssangyong gave up KRW 10 million, which he judged difficult to recover among the KRW 100 million borrowed and invested in unions at the beginning of the year. If a bill related to the cost of burial in New Town is passed by the National Assembly, much of it can be preserved.Industry analysts say the situation will change significantly if 100 million won of investment support requested by creditors is provided. They say that management can be normalized in a short period of time because it can shake off the insolvency that is holding back. In fact, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's guarantee, which amounted to billions of won per year, has decreased to 100 million won as of the end of last year, and the amount of unsold households that reached the previous year is only households.However, despite such self-rescue efforts, KAMCO, a major shareholder of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, was found to have never provided practical funding to normalize its management since last year.The only support measure taken in the process of recovering bonds by indiscriminately selling assets held by Ssangyong was the acquisition of KRW 100 million in asset-backed corporate bills of the Seoul Woo-dong project.In particular, creditors took time to decide whether to start the workout at the beginning of the year, failing to win overseas orders worth billions of won.In the end, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's overseas orders, which were expected to be at least trillion won, amounted to only 100 million won this year, which also hit hard to secure orders to normalize its management.An industry source said, ""It is a great loss for the nation to own Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which is recognized for its technology enough to build the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, which marks the history of architecture of the century.""Reporter Kim Sang Hoon..."
"Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is in crisis as the KRW 100 million investment conversion has virtually failed. Financial authorities and Woori Bank, the main creditor, have also failed to come up with a suitable alternative. As a result, Ssangyong E&C's possibility of court receivership has increased.According to the Japanese financial sector, Woori Bank's KRW 100 million worth of investment conversion plans, each proposed by Woori Bank, were virtually canceled due to opposition from creditors. Creditors say they will have no choice but to go to court management unless Woori Bank offers a new alternative.Without an investment conversion, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction will inevitably be delisted. An official from the creditors said, ""In view of the current situation, it is highly likely that we will have to do it again in a month even if we convert the investment this time.""Financial authorities and Woori Bank are discussing alternatives to revive Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, but they have yet to find a solution."
"Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which is working out as a reporter Lee Jae-woo of Seoul Newsis, was pushed to the brink of collapse after failing to give up the collection of bonds from the Military Mutual Aid Association. The court receivership is imminent as the Military Mutual Aid Association and creditors have failed to reach a compromise over the recovery of the Namyangju Hwado project financing.According to the industry, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction will be unable to pay unless a resolution to support creditors is made by the coming day. It is said that the fund can be physically provided by this month only if the support is decided by this day.The payment amount, including labor costs and materials costs that Ssangyong Engineering & Construction has to pay to its suppliers, amounts to KRW 100 million this month alone. I have to pay back 100 million won next month. Most of the partners borrow money from the financial sector with the payment as collateral, and if Ssangyong Engineering & Construction fails to give money on time, they have to pay back the money instead. A series of bankruptcies are expected.Woori Bank, the main creditor, plans to introduce additional support for Ssangyong Engineering & Construction to a creditors' meeting later this week, but the possibility of a resolution is low.Many creditor banks are known to be negative about the support because additional subsidies can be diverted to the collection of bonds from the Military Mutual Aid Association, not Ssangyong E&C's rehabilitation.Woori Bank asked creditors to agree to a KRW 100 million investment swap and a KRW 100 million new funding plan, but after other creditor banks reacted negatively due to the seizure of the non-convention creditor, the Military Mutual Aid Association, on the grounds of further negotiations.The Military Mutual Aid Association recently seized Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's account after negotiations with creditors to get back KRW 100 million, including principal and interest for the Namyangju Hwado project, failed to reach a compromise.Creditors are demanding the lifting of the seizure and a moratorium on the collection of bonds, but the Military Mutual Aid Association is sticking to its position of collecting them. Lee Soon-woo, chairman of Woori Financial Group, visited Kim Jin-hoon, chairman of the Military Mutual Aid Association, on the last day and asked for the release of the seizure and a moratorium on bond collection, but he was also rejected.In addition, some creditor banks are reportedly insisting on court management, saying that additional support could be a pouring water into the bottomless pit. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is expected to post a deficit of 100 million won per year if there is no additional support.There are many voices in the industry calling for additionally in the industry.This is because Ssangyong Engineering & Construction as well as other partners are on the verge of shaking their foundation for existence, and the international credibility of all Korean companies is expected to decline.If Ssangyong Engineering & Construction goes under court receivership, all debts will be frozen, which is expected to lead to a bankruptcy of its suppliers.It is expected that Ssangyong Engineering & Construction will suffer disruptions in the construction of the total trillion won at the opening site and international litigation will also expected.The industry's view is that Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which has strengths in overseas businesses, is concerned not only about losing its foundation for rehabilitation, but also about a decline in international credibility of the entire Korean company.An industry source said, ""Unlike other companies, there is no loss of construction due to poor guarantees due to the slump in the real estate market,"" adding, ""The court management of Ssangyong E&C is a big loss for the industry as a whole.""

"The Military Mutual Aid Association said it will collect the investment in Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which applied for court receivership.An official from the Japan Military Mutual Aid Association said, ""We regret Ssangyong E&C's application for court receivership, but we have no choice but to collect funds for the benefit of our members.""On the afternoon of the previous day, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction held a board meeting to file an application for court receivership with the Seoul Central District Court. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction and its creditors plan to seek a fast-track rehabilitation system, which is an early termination of the rehabilitation process.For the past few months, creditors of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, including Woori Bank, and the Military Mutual Aid Association have been at odds over the scope of pain sharing. Creditors demanded debt conversion and interest relief as the Military Mutual Aid Association began to recover a total of KRW 100 million, including KRW 100 million and interest loans lent to Ssangyong Engineering & Construction a year ago. The mutual aid association expressed its refusal. The mutual aid association was an unacceptable proposal for us to manage members' assets. He explained that if members ask for breach of trust, they have nothing to say. Instead, the mutual aid association proposed adjusting the interest rate of repayment of KRW 100 million later this year, but failed to reach an agreement with creditors.The Military Mutual Aid Association loan was made to Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's project financing site in Namyangju, Gyeonggi-do, and Ssangyong Engineering & Construction was guaranteed to pay. The mutual aid association has the right to dispose of the workplace if Ssangyong Engineering & Construction fails to return the funds.Some in the financial investment industry point out that creditors forced the Military Mutual Aid Association to make excessive demands. It is difficult to understand that the mutual aid association, a non-convention creditor, is required to share pain at the level of the financial sector, a convention creditor. An official at an investment bank at a securities firm said, ""Creditors seem to have started to make a justification to withdraw from Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's liquidity crisis.""Reporter Lee Seung-jong...The World's Eye on the Window Economy Banned Unauthorized Distribution of Asian Economy"
"Construction companies won bids and fines of 100 billion won at the Incheon Subway Line Construction by dividing almost all sections through bidding collusion.The Fair Trade Commission said Monday it will impose a total of 100 billion won in fines on dog builders who bid for the construction of the Incheon subway line, along with a correction order, and file a complaint with the prosecution.The sanctions included large construction companies such as Daelim Industrial, Daewoo Engineering & Construction, Samsung C&T Construction, POSCO Engineering & Construction, Hyundai Engineering & Construction, and Hyundai Industrial Development.The dog construction company raised the winning bid by pre-setting the prospective bidder for each tool and setting up a bridesmaid in a bid for the construction of the Incheon Metro Line ordered by the Incheon Metropolitan Rapid Transit Construction Headquarters in last month.In this way, the construction section, where bidding collusion took place, reached the opening of the entire opening tool, excluding tools.Large construction companies avoided bleeding competition by bidding for the dog construction site, each of which was a bridesmaid of another large construction company.Hyundai Industrial Development, which won the tool, was the best man for construction, Hyundai Engineering & Construction, Daewoo Engineering & Construction, and Daewoo Engineering & Construction again helped Hyundai Industrial Development.Bridesmaid companies submitted low-quality designs, also known as bridesmaid designs or designs, to help their opponents win.Samsung C&T and Daelim Industrial won the bid for the two tools by setting up Jinheung and Taeyoung Construction as bridesmaids, respectively, while POSCO E&C and Lotte E&C set up their bridesmaids in exchange at the two tools.The rest of the builders' collusion took place in a similar way.Mid-sized construction companies pre-arranged prospective bidders and bridesmaids in the bidding for the rest of the dog tools, except for those in which large companies participated in the bidding.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction set up Seohee Construction as its best man, Taeyoung Construction set up Doosan Engineering & Construction, Daebo Construction, Hanyang Development, Kolon Global Kumho Industrial, Hanyang Shindonga Construction set up Honghwa as its best man.As a result of such collusion, only consortiums participated in the bidding for each tool, and there was no overlapping successful bidders for each tool.

"Sentence Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which was pushed to the ground due to a strong confrontation between creditors in the image area and non-convention creditors, eventually applied for court receivership. It has been months since the workout started last month.With Ssangyong E&C's application for court receivership, the Military Mutual Aid Association, which insisted on collecting loans by mobilizing legal measures such as provisional seizure at the construction site, is in a position to delay the collection of principal and interest. The same is true of creditors, who delayed the decision to provide additional support. It was a small act of passing the blame on each other.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. said it held a board meeting and submitted an application for court receivership to the Seoul Central District Court. A Ssangyong Engineering & Construction official explained the background of the court's management, saying, ""We had no choice but to minimize the damage to our suppliers and normalize the business sites at home and abroad as soon as possible.""Until now, there have been concerns that the creditors' decision to provide additional support to normalize Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's management may lead to a series of bankruptcies. This is because the electronic bill of Ssangyong E&C, which is worth 100 million won, will expire at the end of this month.Electronic bills are a structure in which suppliers take out loans directly from financial institutions with Ssangyong E&C's accounts receivable as collateral, and if Ssangyong E&C fails to repay them on time, its suppliers must pay them back. However, the prevailing analysis was that it would be difficult to avoid a series of bankruptcies as most of the partner companies were suffering from financial difficulties due to the seizure of the construction site of the Military Mutual Aid Association.However, Ssangyong E&C's application for court receivership is expected to ease the burden of repaying electronic bills to some extent. Usually, if a company goes under court receivership, all debts will be frozen, but bonds such as payment of construction costs will be possible. In addition, the seizure of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's construction site by the Military Mutual Aid Association will be lifted, allowing suppliers to pay for the construction.A Ssangyong Engineering & Construction official said, ""Even if we go under court receivership, the obligation to repay electronic bills will not disappear, but the provisional seizure at the construction site will be lifted, so we will use the recovered bonds to ease the financial difficulties of our partners.""The Military Mutual Aid Association, which took extreme measures called seizure at the construction site at the end of last month to recover the loan after delaying the responsibility of the Creditors' Mutual Aid Association, is far from recovering the bond due to the court management of Ssangyong E&C. This is because it is common for companies to go through procedures such as debt reduction and investment conversion as well as debt freezing when they are under court receivership. In this case, not only shareholders of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction but also creditors will suffer losses. Even if some funds can be returned, it can take a long time to recover.The Military Mutual Aid Association can recover some funds by disposing of the Namyangju Hwado plant, which has loan collateral rights, but the sale value of the facility is currently only about KRW 100 million, which is the level of principal and interest. Moreover, the receivables of the Military Mutual Aid Association are classified as subordinate and must bear more losses than other debtors if they enter the court receivership process.An industry source pointed out that the court receivership will not benefit creditors and the Military Mutual Aid Association, adding, ""If Ssangyong Engineering & Construction does not revive early after court receivership, the damage will increase.Ssangyong E&C's all-out management of overseas operations has inevitably hurt Ssangyong E&C's operations. If a construction company goes under court receivership, it will be virtually impossible to win new orders at home and abroad. Unless is promoted, normalization of management will inevitably take a long time.The biggest problem is overseas operations, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's flagship field. This is because new orders as well as existing construction sites can be disrupted, such as the contract being terminated. Currently, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is carrying out overseas as an opening project, with the total size of the project reaching 100 million dollars.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction plans to make all-out efforts to manage its overseas operations to minimize the impact of court receivership. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Chairman Kim Seok-joon and other executives are reportedly discussing follow-up measures with overseas suppliers.An official of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction said, ""We are persuading our customers to carry out normal construction of overseas projects,"" adding, ""We will do our best to ensure that the national status and national interests are not damaged.""An industry source pointed out, ""The court receivership will inevitably hurt overseas operations,"" adding, ""Creditors should also spare no support to prevent Ssangyong Engineering & Construction from causing disruptions to its overseas operations.""Real-time News Money Today Prohibition of Reproduction and Redistribution of Clinical Actor Copyright Owner's Money"
"As Ssangyong E&C, a reporter for Seoul Newsis Lee Jae-woo, applied for court receivership, attention is being paid to the aftermath that will affect its strength overseas business. Overseas projects have served as a lifeline for Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which has been dry in recent years with good returns.According to the industry, Ssangyong E&C's overseas project is to open the country, including the St. Regis Hotel Langkawi Convention Center in Malaysia, the venue of the ASEAN Summit. With a total of trillion won, many projects have been ordered by governments and public companies from countries such as Malaysia.Due to the court receivership, delays in construction of overseas workplaces are expected to be inevitable.Losses in the domestic financial sector that have guaranteed payment and legal disputes with overseas orders are also expected. In particular, if the construction of the ASEAN Summit is suspended, there will be a lot of consequences such as litigation with the Malaysian government.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction announced that it will make every effort to persuade the ordering company to carry out the construction work normally immediately after applying for court receivership so that the national status and national interests are not damaged.It said it will seek a fast-track recovery to prevent the loss of overseas competitiveness and technology brand value, which is Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's largest asset.Creditors also decided to continue to provide funds needed to complete Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's current overseas construction site.The problem is businesses that are on the verge of winning orders. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction has been selected as the preferred negotiator for the subway construction in Doha, Qatar, worth billions of won.It is known that the number of projects that have passed the preliminary screening of bid participation qualifications from overseas orders such as Singapore and Indonesia and are seeking to win business orders has also reached trillion won.These projects are expected to be difficult to win orders due to court receivership applications.According to the industry, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction previously handed over the Singapore complex construction project, which had been dominated by the lowest bid due to the financial crisis, to overseas companies due to the delayed start of the workout. The Doha subway construction in Qatar was also a project that Chairman Kim Seok-joon had obtained the understanding of the client.An official from Ssangyong Engineering & Construction said, ""We plan to persuade the client as much as possible to prevent the construction from being stopped,"" but added, ""It is a serious crisis that cannot be solved only by the company's own efforts.""

"Ssangyong Engineering & Construction headquarters located in Sincheon-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction applied for corporate rehabilitation procedures as it was virtually unable to expand its legal management application capital, and Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which is working on improving confirmed companies, did not receive support from creditors. As capital expansion became impossible, delisting was virtually confirmed.According to the Japanese construction industry, the application for court management was decided at Ssangyong E&C's emergency board meeting held later in the day.

"After months of workout, Ssangyong E&C applied for court receivership about months after it entered the workout due to the labor union KAMCO's insolvency as scheduled. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which once rose to the top of the contract, failed to overcome financial difficulties and went under court receivership, making it inevitable for its partner Juldosan and overseas markets to lose confidence in domestic builders. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. said it applied for court receivership with the Seoul Central District Court in the face of a liquidity crisis that cannot be solved by the company's efforts alone without additional support from its creditors.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction added that if the application for court receivership is delayed, additional damage is inevitable, such as delayed payment to several partner companies, and the aftermath may be affected at home and abroad.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction went under court receivership because construction of an apartment site in Hwado, Namyangju, led to insolvency. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction participated as a construction company and provided KRW 100 million to the developer with the participation of the Military Mutual Aid Association, which was carried out in a project financing manner, and Ssangyong Engineering & Construction provided payment guarantees. However, as the developer went bankrupt, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction was in a position to repay KRW 100 million instead.Creditors of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction demanded that the Military Mutual Aid Association convert KRW 100 million, including principal and interest, into equity at Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, but the Military Mutual Aid Association did not accept it. Ssangyong Engineering & Construction planned to repay the funds of the Military Mutual Aid Association after selling the Udong condominium construction site in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul, where construction was currently suspended, but eventually went to court due to the failure of the sale due to the sluggish real estate market.An official from Woori Bank, the main creditor bank, said, ""With the domestic housing market and the economy so bad, discussions on additional support from creditors seem to have been delayed, and Ssangyong E&C seems to think that the application for court receivership is the most desirable.Criticism is also expected to rise that the worst claim of insolvency during the KAMCO is also a failure to restructure the government. Most of Ssangyong E&C's insolvency accumulated between the year and the month when KAMCO managed it. Ssangyong E&C claims that the company had no choice but to go under court receivership because KAMCO did not properly manage it during this period.A union official said, ""When KAMCO managed it, there were a series of parachute appointments, including auditors and outside directors, and no actual restructuring was carried out,"" adding, ""Ssangyong Construction's management did not take any responsibility.""Even if Ssangyong E&C goes under court receivership, construction underway at home and abroad is expected to proceed as scheduled.As for the domestic construction underway by Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, there are households at the opening site scheduled to move in next month, but it is expected that there will be no problem in moving in as Korea Housing Guarantee is providing sales guarantees.Ssangyong Engineering & Construction is expected to avoid the worst situation of liquidation even if it goes under court receivership. According to an asset evaluation conducted by Yale Accounting Corp. last month, the company's survival value was 100 million won, more than the liquidation value of 100 million won.Ssangyong E&C intends to work with court creditors to get out of court receivership as much as possible.

"I used up all my personal wealth and paid him by the end of the monthI'm at a loss now. They're all going to dieYoon Chang-min, CEO of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's subcontractor, was speechless. The total life expectancy of corporate workers, including CEO Yoon, will be cut off from this month. This is because Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's KRW 100 million credit sales bonds, which were cut off to the company instead of the construction cost last month, expired and became an official bill. Originally, the original contractor can take out loans from the bank with this bond that he buys and pay it back. However, Ssangyong E&C went under court receivership last month. Under the loan regulations, the debt became a share from that day. Financial transactions are impossible due to poor credit if they are overdue more than daily. CEO Yoon said, ""The company, which had only a debt ratio, has a life left. He vented his anger, saying, ""All that's left is evil.""As Ssangyong Engineering & Construction marks its first day of court receivership, the bankruptcy of several subcontractors such as private companies is becoming a reality. On the surface, Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which has lost support from creditors, cannot pay back the loans it has to give to companies through banks. The companies, which are on the verge of credit delinquency, are poised to take collective action. However, some strongly point out that the fundamental cause is the loan system itself. According to the current situation, the subcontractors who accept credit bonds cut off by the original contractor who went under court receivership or went bankrupt like Ssangyong Engineering & Construction have to bear them.According to the Japanese construction industry, Ssangyong E&C's accounts receivable to subcontractors after the workout is worth a total of 100 million won. In other words, female companies received loans of the same size. This includes the amount of money that should have been paid by last month. Creditor banks discounted 100 million won worth of the billion won to companies first. This is because Ssangyong E&C received a bill discount limit of 100 million won at the time of the workout. A financial analyst in the construction industry said, ""We understand that through this, female suppliers have put out the urgent fire.""However, the problem is that this billion won is also a debt that companies will be pressured to repay over time. This is why some in the construction industry are cautiously raising opinions that creditors should at least prevent them by making loan repayments.The bigger problem is female companies that have not even received a discount on bills. They have to pay off their loans themselves without any support from the bank. The professional construction industry, where subcontractors gathered, agreed that the root cause of the situation lies in the loan system, which they call the devil system. is a product that the subcontractor borrows from the trading bank as collateral for accounts receivable issued by the original contractor instead of the construction price. If the original contractor fails to pay within the maturity, the subcontractor must pay back the principal and overdue interest instead. Therefore, the bankruptcy or legal management of the original contractor causes the subcontractor to go bankrupt.In response to industry concerns, the government reorganized the related system last month. The Financial Supervisory Service also reportedly sent an official letter to creditors last month asking them to ban Ssangyong Engineering & Construction's partners from restricting normal business activities and to launch programs for small and medium-sized companies, including temporary funding.However, a representative of a subcontractor of Ssangyong E&C said in a telephone interview with the Japanese Herald Economy, ""The FSS sent an official letter three times a day, but the creditor banks said, ""We trusted the creditor banks and took out loans.""

"The Korea Exchange, a reporter for Jung Joon-young and Hwang Chul-hwan, said, ""As a result of the audit of the monthly settlement corporation for the business year, the reason for delisting occurred in the opening of the securities market and KOSDAQ market.""Among the monthly settlement corporations, the exchange received and reviewed business reports of the opening of the securities market and the opening of the KOSDAQ market, excluding foreign corporations.As a result of the review, in the case of the securities market, the listing of individual companies such as Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering and Fine Asset Management was confirmed, and Tongyang E&C and Byeoksan E&C will also be delisted if they do not submit business reports by the day.Hyundai Cement Engine Tong Yang Networks has been subject to a substantial review of its eligibility for listing, and the listing disclosure committee will deliberate on rocket electricity, which submitted an objection after it was announced to be delisted due to the rejection of audit opinions.By reason, capital erosion was the most common, followed by full capital erosion related to audit opinions and shortfall of stock distribution requirements for more than a year in a row.In a related development, the Korea Exchange has newly designated TICCO, Hyundai Cement, Unichem, Rocket, Electric Engine, Heavy Industries, and Shinwoo as management items.The number of companies that caused delisting in the KOSDAQ market decreased from last year, and the number of non-appropriate corporations for audit opinions decreased sharply from opening to opening.Companies that have been delisted include EverTechno Araon Tech Unid Korea Digittech System, which is filing an objection due to the rejection of audit opinions from Morinth, Taesan LCD Ssangyong Engineering & Construction, which was delisted on the last month due to the erosion of M-Texvision's capital.If a company that rejects the audit opinion files an objection within a day after notification of delisting, it will be decided whether to delist it after deliberation by the listing committee within a day from the date of application.It was included in companies that did not submit a business report and that caused delisting.The newly designated corporation as a management item was similar to the previous year, but as of this day, the number of management items was reduced from the same time last year.Investor stocks such as EverTechno Garden Ensys AraonTech Dastech Unid Korea Digitec System Tongyang Cement Ssangyong Engineering & Construction have been newly designated.

"About 15 days before the closing of the monthly settlement corporation's settlement of accounts last year, a number of stocks are feared to be designated as management stocks. The possibility of being designated as a management stock or delisting is rising as the capital erosion rate is over or continuously sluggish performance is announced.In the Japanese KOSDAQ market, Wise Power and Dastech KDC EverTechno Turbo Tech all hit the lower limit one after another due to concerns over the designation of management stocks. In recent weeks, stocks that have fallen to the price limit due to related reasons have been steadily emerging. Most companies have seen their stock prices plunge for four consecutive days.Listed companies are required to compile and disclose last year's internal settlement results by the end of this month. For this reason, a series of stocks that are likely to be designated as management stocks have been pouring in, announcing sluggish performance since early this month.According to the Financial Supervisory Service's electronic disclosure system, the company was closed this month alone after the possibility that MTech Vision PS&G Hanjin P&C Daesung Eltech Sports Seoul's Taesan LCD EverTechno KC Turbo Tech Osung ST Dastech LComtech Wise Power could be designated or delisted as management stocks.These stocks usually exceeded the capital erosion rate last year or recorded consecutive operating losses during the recent business year. Many companies have suffered continuous business losses before deducting corporate tax costs that exceed their equity capital in the recent business year.Stocks with related concerns are expected to increase sharply by the end of this month, the deadline for internal settlement. Related companies will be determined whether to designate management stocks based on the actual audit results of external auditors.Among them, some stocks are suspected of unfair trade using internal prior information. The Exchange Market Monitoring Committee pointed out that major shareholders and executives and employees among companies that have recently been designated as management stocks or are feared to be delisted can use important information in advance regarding poor performance or audit opinions. It intentionally discloses the favorable information of the company to induce general investors to buy it, and then sells its holdings when stock prices rebound.According to the city inspection committee, internal officials usually sell stocks in advance just before the unfavorable disclosure, causing trading volume to surge without any special reason, and stock prices to fall or intentionally announce favorable disclosures to boost stock prices. In addition, companies designated for management items temporarily announced that their performance has improved, and then started financing such as a paid-in capital increase, but later it was canceled after receiving a rejection of audit opinions.Stocks that have recently announced sluggish performance have soared and plunged again without clear reasons, causing stock prices to fluctuate.Meanwhile, many other companies have recently raised the possibility of delisting at all due to complete capital erosion and rejection of audit opinions on business reports. According to the exchange, there is a possibility of liquidation of pharmaceutical companies such as Byeoksan Construction and Dongyang Construction Industry, combining the securities market and the KOSDAQ market."

"As the deadline for submitting the business report of reporter Park Cho-rong's monthly settlement corporation is just around the corner, fears of delisting are gradually growing in the stock market.According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, companies that are on the verge of delisting due to audit-related reasons such as rejection of audit opinions due to complete capital erosion are the opening of securities markets and KOSDAQ markets.Including listed companies that have passed the deadline for submitting audit reports and companies that have fallen short of stock distribution standards, the largest new company could be kicked out of the stock market.This year, a series of group affiliates and construction companies, whose capital has been fully eroded, faced a crisis of delisting.Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, which has a capital erosion rate of ., is certain to be delisted as it has received an audit opinion. As of the end of last year, the total capital of Chosun Marine Co. was KRW 100 trillion, including capital, which has been forgotten.With Chosun Marine's market capitalization reaching KRW 100 trillion, creditors are prioritizing corporate rehabilitation rather than maintaining the listing, which seems to be out of the crisis of exiting the stock market due to the completion of the debt-for-equity swap, but no data have yet been received from the Korea Exchange.The engine has also been suspended from trading as its capital has been eroded and limited to audit opinions.These companies, which are subject to delisting due to capital erosion, will inevitably be delisted if they fail to prove their capital erosion to the exchange by this month.Byeoksan Engineering & Construction and Tongyang Engineering & Construction, which failed to acquire and acquire to avoid capital erosion, are also likely be delisted.Byeoksan E&C applied to the Seoul Central District Court on the last day to abolish the corporate rehabilitation process after a series of attempts to target the Akid Consortium and the City & Housing Consortium failed. The court will decide whether to go bankrupt by collecting opinions from creditors and others on the abolition of rehabilitation procedures by the day.In addition, there was a reason for delisting in Hyundai Cement Rocket Electric Fine Asset Management.On the KOSDAQ market, Morinth Taesan LCD Osung LST is on the verge of being kicked out due to a full capital erosion.There is a high possibility that EverTechno Araon Tech Unid Korea's Elcomtech, which the accounting auditor submitted an audit report due to refusal of opinion or improperly, will also be delisted.If the company does not file an objection after receiving an audit opinion as a rejection or inappropriate, the delisting process will proceed immediately.If the submission of the business report is closed at the end of this month, it will be outlined which companies will be kicked out, but the reality is that it is difficult to revive where they fell into a complete capital erosion or received audit opinions.Even if capital erosion is resolved, companies must undergo a substantial examination of the listing eligibility of the exchange.Companies that fail to meet the deadline for submitting audit reports will go through the delisting process if they fail to submit the report by next month.연합뉴스앱 궁금한배틀 화보 포토무비저작권자 연합뉴스 무단 전재재배포 금지"

"The aftereffects of the Kiko incident, which took place a long time ago, are still scary. This is because mid-sized companies, which have suffered huge losses due to the financial crisis in the past year after signing a contract for KIKO, a currency option product, are in crisis in the stock market this year. The main characters are Taesan LCD and Mtech Vision.Last year's business report was limited to audit opinions. The limitation of audit opinion is that it needs to be supplemented, and in the case of Taesan LCD, it is unclear whether it will end during the current workout.The reason why Taesan LCD entered the workout is that it lost nearly KRW 100 million in KIKO contracts for currency option products due to the financial crisis. Taesan LCD, a solid mid-sized company with annual sales of trillion won, went into a workout at once due to losses related to KIKO and had to undergo bone-cutting restructuring by carrying out large-scale capital cuts.It is known that Kiko is on the verge of normalization after shaking off losses last year, but Kiko's recovery was deeper than expected. The Sungdo Accounting Corporation, an audit corporation of Taesan LCD, has limited its audit opinion on the grounds that the loans to be repaid this year are in the range of 100 million won. This is because last year's capital erosion condition has improved due to potatoes, but this time its performance is being hampered. As he focused on making up for the insolvency caused by KIKO, he couldn't help but suffer from insolvency in his main business. Although it newly entered the set business last year, it is not easy because it is already saturated market.M-Tech Vision is in a similar situation. M-Tech Vision's loss to KIKO is worth hundreds of millions of won. Last year, Kiko won some of the lawsuits, but it was difficult to recover the business that lost money. In the end, M-Tech Vision applied for court receivership last month and received a rejection of its audit opinion on last year's business report, resulting in a reason for delisting.At the time of filing for court receivership, Lee Sung-min, president of M-Texvision, said that KIKO's debt repayment financing and pressure was too great and that as a CEO, he spent most of his time escaping financial pressure, not normalization of the company. It has been years since the Kiko incident broke out and the court ruled in favor, but the raw cuts left in their hearts are still hurting.

"It is predicted that Taesan LCD will graduate from the workout this year. Taesan LCD received limited opinions from external audits accordingly.Son Hak-ik, director of Taesan LSD, said in a telephone interview with the Japanese economy, ""The workout period will end on Monday this year, but the possibility of graduation is unclear,"" adding, ""We are making efforts to repay loans by selling real estate, but the burden of loans is high."" The company has to repay its loan of 100 million won by Monday. Director Son added that the reason why the accounting firm in charge of external audits issued a limited opinion is because it is unclear whether the workout will end. Sungdo Accounting Corporation, which externally audited Taesan LCD, presented limited opinions related to the audit report for last year's business year.Taesan LcD was a blue-chip company that produced Yongbaeklight units, but it was on the verge of bankruptcy due to the derivative KIKO contract. Last year, it suffered a net loss of 100 million won when it joined derivatives contracts linked to exchange rates such as KIKO. Although it was on the verge of delisting due to the erosion of its entire capital, it survived the stock market due to the workout of creditor banks. Hana Bank, KEB, Shinhan Bank, and Korea Development Bank have started to convert their investments and are currently the largest shareholders held by Hana Bank. In addition, Samsung Electronics cooperated to maintain supply volume and posted net profit of 100 million won last year, showing signs of revival.However, Samsung Electronics' production of supplies has been transferred to China, and the ordeal has come again. Last year, Taesan LCD stopped domestic production and operated mainly in China, resulting in a sharp drop in performance. Taesan LCD suffered sales of 100 million won and operating losses of 100 million won last year. Net loss for the current term also reached 100 million won. Compared to last year, sales have decreased. The amount of operating losses and net losses increased side by side by side.Director Son said, ""It is difficult to recover performance due to the suspension of domestic dragon production,"" and explained, ""It is unclear whether the increase in production volume at the Chinese plant this year will make up for it.""Taesan LCD cut its capital last month to improve its financial structure, but its plan to increase capital is unclear. The company's stake in CEO Choi Tae-hyun fell from . to . after the company's monthly reduction last year. Capital needs to be further expanded through paid-in capital increase, but there are no specific plans yet. Director Son explained that there is a need for a paid-in capital increase, but there is no plan yet.Reporter Kang Donghyo... People who enjoy listening to Korean music are shocked by this.

"Taesan LCD closed the deal at the won, which fell to the price limit as it was limited in the daily audit report.The sharp drop in Taesan LCD is due to the limited decision regarding the audit report for the business year. Sungsung Accounting Corp., which externally audited Taesan LCD, said its current liabilities far exceeded current assets and are set to repay loans, adding that it is uncertain whether the company will continue. Taesan LCD has more than 100 million won in loans to be paid back by the end of this year.Taesan LCD is on the verge of delisting due to the KIKO contract, a derivative based on the annual exchange rate, but it has revived due to creditors' workouts and management's self-rescue efforts. Although it recovered its performance with a net profit of KRW 100 million a year, its performance deteriorated again due to the suspension of domestic production of its flagship backlight unit for liquid crystal display. Last year's operating loss and net loss amounted to 100 million won, respectively.Reporter Kang Donghyo... People who enjoy listening to Korean music are shocked by this.

"Set manufacturer Taesan L.S.D., which is in the process of a workout, said that it is pushing for a merger and acquisition before the sketch will come out before the end of the year-end workout. On the news, the price of LCD soared to the upper limit. As the deadline for the memorandum of understanding on the implementation of the workout signed with creditors ends at the end of this year, it is expected to accelerate in the future. It has not selected not only the acquisition company but also the organizer to see how far it has progressed. However, I understand that the council of bond financial institutions, including Hana Bank and Shinhan Bank, is continuously pushing for the normalization of Taesan LCD's management and successful workout graduation. As creditors and this year's month is set as the end date of the workout, a sketch is expected to come out before then. In this year's audit report, he received a limited opinion from an external accounting firm, which issued a limited opinion, citing that the loan should be repaid immediately this year to reach 100 million won. Although it is trying to repay loans by selling real estate, it is true that operating profit continues to be in the red. Didn't the financial structure improve to some extent through the reduction last year? Last year, we were able to escape from the capital erosion to some extent through the reduction. In addition, the number of issued stocks was large, so a reduction was conducted. However, it is not easy to improve the financial structure due to poor performance. Some are talking about additional capital increase or reduction, but there are no plans for the time being. Although it is true that the current status of the set business that newly entered last year is difficult because Samsung occupies the domestic market, it is focusing on increasing customer satisfaction with its own quality. Currently, it is only sold on the online site Auction, but it is considering offline sales such as Hi-Mart. The plan is to expand the set sales network to China and the eurozone. It seems that it will be easy to secure a sales network in China as it is producing sets from its Chinese subsidiaries, Taesan and Kihan Corporation.Reporter Han Donghoon...

The explanation is that mergers and acquisitions have many variables until the contract is completed, and the stock price is also more affected by how much more expensive it is to sell than the sale itself and who is the party to the acquisition.A small cap analyst said Byeoksan Engineering & Construction and Taesan LCD, which recently plunged due to failure, are a typical example, and it is safe to invest considering the possibility of signing a contract and how expensive it is sold."

"There was no brake for DID, a sound mid-sized display company, to fall. The withdrawal of funds from the financial sector came like a tsunami as a major Japanese shareholder, who was in charge of managing the company, irresponsibly decided to give up management. Samsung Display also collected manufacturing facilities installed here, which was a car partner, and the last ladder for rehabilitation disappeared. Dawn investors, who have invested in trust that they are a reliable Japanese major shareholder and a Samsung partner, are in panic due to the sudden suspension of stock trading. What happened to the KOSDAQ blue-chip companies that were on the verge of bankruptcy in just a few months?Launched as a joint venture between South Korea and Japan in last month, is a partner of Samsung Display and has been laying the groundwork for its business with backlight units, which are key devices for displays. After a joint venture between a private businessman and Japan's Yamato Science, Kowa took over its stake in Yamato Science and secured management rights. Mr. sold his stake years ago. As of the end of last year, Kowa is the largest shareholder with minority shareholders. After it was listed on the KOSDAQ for the year, it also won a billion-dollar export tower from the Korea International Trade Association in the month before. However, there was a risk of insolvency inside such splendid growth.Due to the expansion of supply volume, facility investment was carried out excessively, and Samsung's tablet volume has decreased in recent years, resulting in a decrease in sales and accumulation of deficits. According to the business report, annual sales fell by only KRW 100 million year-on-year, resulting in operating losses of KRW 100 million.A decisive blow that broke the will of the council, which is in urgent need of self-rescue measures, unexpectedly occurred inside the company. The major shareholder, Kowa Group, has brought in in-house directors, including the Japanese CEO, to their home countries. It actually meant withdrawing the business. Kowa Group previously set up candidates for directors as Koreans at its shareholders' meeting, but they rejected the candidates for directors, so the management is unable to make any decisions while they are empty.Banks were immediately shaken when Kowa Group, a leading pharmaceutical company with a history of years in Japan, abandoned. Korea Exchange Bank, the main creditor, has overdue some 100 million won in operating funds due late last month and has begun a massive bond collection process. Manufacturing facilities in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, were suspended due to the suspension of payment of operating funds to run the factory, and executives and employees who once exceeded their employees left the company. All of this happened a week after the shareholders' meeting late last month. Currently, only about executives and employees remain, and it announced the suspension of business due to the abandonment of major shareholders' management on the last day.Employees who resigned from the company are preparing to file criminal charges against directors of Kowa Group in Japan, asking them to take responsibility for violating their duty of election and breach of trust under the Commercial Act.Financial authorities are also reportedly investigating the truth about the controversy over the irresponsible management abandonment of Kowa Group executives as more than a few minority shareholders were damaged.A Korean executive here said, ""Even if we want to go through court rehabilitation procedures, we can't apply because the decision-making system, such as the CEO's absence, is gone,"" adding, ""Isn't it common sense that major shareholders should take responsibility and do their best to manage the company?On the other hand, Kowa Group emphasized that the abandonment of management at the time was due to the decision of the shareholders' meeting, saying that the names of its executives and employees resigned at the regular shareholders' meeting on Monday.On the contrary, Kowa Group argued that while he had repeated numerous attempts to increase the allocation of students, which is unlikely to be realized in his position in charge of operations, he had never seriously considered and prepared an application for bankruptcy, the only option.We cannot understand why the Japanese headquarters of Kowa Group is not trying to maintain its business value by using measures recognized by laws such as rehabilitation procedures. The company officially explained, ""We believe it is difficult to maintain cooperative relations with Mr. Lee and others anymore.""He also gave an unconvincing answer to market order disruptions such as damage to minority shareholders. Japan's Kowa said, ""We understand that the criticism of minority shareholders and workers is due to information posted by Mr. Lee and others,"" and repeatedly confirmed that the suspension of stock trading and the bankruptcy crisis have nothing to do with their management withdrawal.

"Samsung Display is considering moving its domestic display module business to Vietnam and China after separating its organic light-emitting diode business from Samsung Display due to a series of withdrawal from its production line before moving its module business to Vietnam and China due to a surge in labor costs. It is moving its module production bases to Vietnam and China because it is judged that it is impossible to produce them in Korea due to a sharp increase in labor costs and a lack of balance.According to a number of senior officials from Samsung Group and its electronics affiliates, Samsung Display is considering withdrawing from its display module business in Cheonan and other countries. Accordingly, it is expected that South Korean businesses will be organized in time for the full-scale operation of module factories in Vietnam.A Samsung source said, ""In case of Samsung Electronics, after receiving the product in the form of an open cell from Samsung Display, the rest of the process was being completed at the module factory overseas.""The display process is divided into cells and modules, and Samsung is considering moving overseas this time. During the display process, only module processes are moved to Vietnam because most of the cell processes are automated, but the module processes have a high proportion of labor costs due to many manual tasks. The module is close to assembly. Assemble the polarizing plate and the driving chip backlight in turn on the completed panel.Samsung Display, which was working on modules in Korea, also tried to automate the module process, but it stopped because it was difficult to develop equipment and was not more effective than manual work.In addition, customers who used to receive finished products in the form of modules in the past have increased supply in the form of open cells, which is one of the main reasons for the consideration of withdrawing from the domestic module business. In many cases, module work is done directly to reduce costs.Instead of withdrawing module production lines from South Korea, Samsung Display is planning to increase the proportion of its Vietnamese plant and its module plant located in Dongguan, China, which are being built by investing trillion won last year. This is because it can secure profitability as it is advantageous in terms of labor costs.An official from the display industry said, ""The display module industry has been struggling for several years, with major shareholders of DID, a mid-sized company that mainly produced display modules, deciding to suspend operations,"" adding, ""As seen in this case, cost competition is intensifying.""Reporter Myung Jin Kyu...Reporter Kim Eunbyul...Reporter Son Sunhee...

"Body DID, a company specializing in display parts in image areas, is in a quagmire. At the end of last year, the largest shareholder failed to sell its stake, and the recent ambitious financing situation is not easy. At one time, it was mentioned as a Psy theme stock and the stock price exceeded 10,000 won, but before I knew it, it became a grave for ants.DID closed the market at a lower won than the previous day. Stock prices plummeted on news that the company's paid-in capital increase to raise funds failed. DID announced on the last day that the paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million in student allocation, which was announced on the last day, was not fully paid. The par value per share of new shares that were to be issued was KRW, higher than the closing price of the day.Due to the failure of the paid-in capital increase, DID's funding plan also turned on a red light. In addition to the paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million announced on the last day, DID is conducting a paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million. Again, the planned face value per share is higher than the closing price of KRW, so it is not guaranteed to be successful.DID has also decided to issue bonds with non-separation-type private equity underwriting rights worth 100 million won and is raising funds. The exercise price per share announced at the surface interest rate maturity rate is KRW. The price is higher than the closing price of the day.DID also announced the sale of its largest shareholder's stake last month, but the contract could not be made because the buyer did not pay the funds. At that time, Kowa, the largest shareholder of the Japanese company, tried to sell the total manju for a total of 100 million won per share, but DSI, who was the buyer, failed to pay the balance, and only 10,000 shares were actually acquired. The sale price of the stake, including management rights, was lower than the closing price of DID on the contract date last year, but the contract was not signed. DID, which produces a module that is mounted on tablet laptops, was once incorporated into Psy theme stocks and stock prices soared. When Psy's song Gangnam Style became popular around the world, stock prices soared and exceeded 10,000 won during the day. At that time, DIA, run by Psy's father Park Won-ho, was a major shareholder of DID, and Chairman Park was also participating in management as a registered executive of DID.The heyday of DID didn't last long. Due to sluggish business conditions in front-line industries such as Wow and laptops, it turned into a deficit with an operating loss of KRW 100 million in the year, and the cumulative operating loss in the quarter failed to improve profitability with KRW 100 million last year. As of the end of last quarter, the debt ratio reached .DID planned to raise a total of 100 million won through paid-in capital increase and issuance this year and acquire other corporate securities, or companies, of which 100 million won, but it is difficult to raise funds. As of the end of the quarter of last year, the share of minority shareholders among DID shares was . As a result of the fall in stock prices, only the losses of individual investors are increasing. Individual investors are pointing out the company's lack of communication through the online community. Although he is curious about efforts to improve the performance of the plan of other large-scale financing companies by selling shares of the largest shareholder, he complains that the company is consistent in silence.In response, a DID official said, ""We have not yet confirmed the details of the fundraising process and the acquisition of the company since then,"" adding, ""We are continuously making efforts to normalize the company.""Reporter Kim Doyoon...Real-time News Money Today, where copyright holders' money is visible, cannot be reproduced or redistributed without permission"

"Listed companies that are trying to hide flaws by repeatedly changing their names are on the cutting board. Although the company is changing its name to enhance its image, many companies are taking on risk factors such as bankruptcy, embezzlement, and management disputes, requiring caution in investment.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, KOSDAQ-listed companies that have changed their names since the second half of last year have recorded operating losses in more than recent years.Playtech, which makes mobile peripherals such as charger holders, changed its name to Rocket Mobile last year. The company changed its name to enhance its image as net loss of around 100 million won was expected for the next year in a row after turning into a deficit. Playtech has already changed its mission from last year's Waldastech.Regen is definitely the champion in this field. It changed its name twice last year alone. It has changed its name as many times in the past year.The company is proposing simple corporate image enhancement for the purpose of changing its name, but the reality is nothing but a shadow. The company was embroiled in rumors of embezzlement last month when its creditor DreamMax filed a complaint with the police on charges of embezzlement of executives and employees, and the trading of stock certificates was suspended the previous day as it was designated as an unfaithful corporation due to the delay in the lawsuit. Of course, the financial position has not improved at all, with net losses continuing from year to year.Youngjin Corporation, a water treatment and earthworks company that has been in the red for years, changed its current mission to its current name early this year after passing from Yonsei University to Youngjin Infrastructure YJ Bricks.

Only the issuance of bonds with underwriting rights announced by the company last year amounts to 100 million won. Investment caution is required as bankruptcy rumors have been raised at one time.In addition, all of the NRK Wizkov biosigns are trying to hide their poor financial status through a change of name.In general, mutual change is preferred as a strategy to enhance the image of companies that do not have high corporate size or recognition. However, investors will have to judge carefully as some listed companies have deteriorated to a level of uncertainty.An official from the financial investment industry said, ""Companies that change their names frequently should look at the disclosure and changes in shareholders,"" and added, ""We should pay attention to whether they change their names simply to enhance their image without improving internal profitability or changing their business.""

"Since a few years ago, financial authorities have been thinning out stocks that have run deficits for more than years. In this way, other places, such as P&Tel, which have been designated as management items throughout this year, have already been delisted due to bankruptcy.There is a growing possibility that the number of companies that fall under this category will increase next year. Among the companies that recorded operating losses for consecutive years until last year, tens of thousands of companies have suffered cumulative losses until this quarter. The reason why companies in the red are hit by iron clubs in the year is why the Korea Exchange announced a plan to advance the annual listing system and applied the listing regulations immediately from the following year. The key to this regulation is to issue a notification of designation or delisting of management items if operating losses are recorded for consecutive years based on separate financial statements.An official of the exchange explained that the purpose of the regulation is to determine whether it can make profits and maintain its listing through actual business activities on the separate basis instead of consolidated financial statements.In addition, separate financial statements with operating deficits are based on financial statements for the relevant business year, not comparative financial statements. In other words, even if the financial statements change later, they will not be applied retroactively.Kim Jong-eun, head of KOSDAQ disclosure team at the Korea Exchange, said, ""The business report for the year is already audited by external auditors, so even if there has been some adjustment in the company's situation, it will not be accepted."" According to FnGuide, a securities information company, and the Korea Exchange Financial Supervisory Service's electronic disclosure system, all KOSDAQ-listed companies have accumulated operating losses for more than a year until this quarter.Except for technology-enhancing companies, there are places left. Technology growth companies may suffer losses for more than a year due to special listing regulations.Excluding technology growth companies, Inner Tech, Seoul Electronics, Communications, Baeksan Turbo Tech, KPM Tech, Polyvision AT Technology, Regen Cube Reneco Playwith Parman Youngjin Corporation, Jway Solgo Bio Integrated Energy, CIXC General Capital Deco & Co. Osung, etc. are right-handed Huviron Ptel.Osung, ST, KPM Tech, Jway and Playwith have already been shackled to management stocks for other reasons such as capital erosion.Among the rest, Seoul Electronics, Turbo Tech, Polyvision, AT Technology, Regen Cube, CXC General Capital Deco & Co., Ltd., Korea Resources Investment Development, and Barunson managed to avoid branding as insolvent companies thanks to exchange regulations. In the financial statements that were later changed, it was revised to an operating deficit, but it was recorded as an operating surplus in the financial statements for the relevant business year a year ago.Therefore, due to poor sales, the places that can be classified as a blacklist of annual management items have been narrowed down to Inner Tech, Baeksan, Solgo Bio, Huviron, Reneco Parcan, Youngjin Corporation, Integrated Energy Coone, and others. Although it has recorded cumulative operating losses so far this quarter, whether it is possible to reverse the deficit at the end of the quarter, attention is being paid to some places that are aiming to reverse it at the end of the quarter as the scale is not large.If these companies make up for their cumulative operating losses in the last quarter of this year's business year at once, they could dramatically move away from the threshold of delisting as well as designating management items.Inner Tech, which operates a wireless solution business, has suffered accumulated operating losses of about 100 million won by this quarter. Although it recorded an operating loss of about 100 million won until the first half of last year, it made an operating profit of about 100 million won last quarter and drastically reduced the deficit.The black box manufacturer, Cowon, is the opposite. The company, which posted a cumulative operating profit of about 10,000 won until the first half of last year, recorded an operating loss of about 100 million won last quarter, turning into a deficit of about 100 million won now.Integrated Energy, an energy company, has made a cumulative operating loss of about KRW 100 million so far so far, and Huviron and Solgo Bio have also made a cumulative deficit of less than KRW 100 million, but all of these companies have made operating losses in the recent quarter.Hankyung Dotcom Planning and Reporting Team.

"There were only KOSDAQ companies that failed to submit audit reports, so there were no sanctions even after the possibility of delisting, raising anxiety among ants and issuing warnings to the stock market. This is because some listed companies have passed the deadline but have not submitted audit reports. Investors of listed companies are also becoming more anxious. Many are raising concerns that the company may have a problem, given that its recent performance has been significantly sluggish and that it has not submitted a business report. Stock prices are also plummeting, but the problem is that there are virtually no suitable sanctions against the delay in submitting audit reports.According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, the total number of companies that did not submit the report until the last day, the deadline for submitting the audit report, was found to be the total number of companies. Only in the KOSDAQ market, the submission deadline has passed, and in the securities market and the KONEX market, each place has not submitted audit reports. Stocks incorporated into management stocks are also included.According to the regulations, external auditors must submit audit reports of financial statements no later than a week before the regular shareholders' meeting. If the audit opinion is not appropriate from an external auditor, the listed company will be withdrawn from the stock market.Caution for delay in submitting audit reports Usually, delay in submitting audit reports is a sign that internal problems have occurred in the company. Therefore, investor caution is needed. In fact, last year, Unid Korea fell to the lower limit due to delays in submitting audit reports, and after receiving non-appropriate audit opinions, it took steps to delist.EduBox fell to the lower limit the previous day due to the failure to submit an audit report, and also closed sharply on the same day. Analysts say that anxiety over the inadequacy of the audit opinion has played a role as it recorded an operating loss of KRW 100 million last year and has been in the operating deficit for the consecutive year since then. The company explained that the submission is being delayed because external auditors are demanding supplementary data on financial statements. Acupix also closed at the won, a sharp drop from the previous trading day. Acupix has been in the operating deficit for consecutive years since last year, recording an operating loss of KRW 100 million last year.In the securities market, the deadline for submitting an audit report has been passed on the grounds that Gyeongnam Company failed to receive the revised and confirmed audit report of its subsidiary. Gyeongnam Enterprise is on the verge of delisting, with stock trading suspended from the past as it has fallen into a state of complete capital erosion. Last year, operating losses recorded net losses of KRW 100 million and net losses of KRW 100 million, resulting in a total capital of KRW 10 million. Currently, Gyeongnam Enterprise is under investigation by the prosecution over allegations of corruption in overseas resource development.Including a large number of management items, companies designated for management items such as AK Wise Power, L Energy, Jalman Tech, Sublimation, Pretek, Codes Combine, and Shinwoo have not submitted audit reports, drawing keen attention from the market. In fact, the Korea Exchange has demanded Wise Power and L Energy to disclose inquiries on rumors of operating losses and capital erosion for consecutive years.In the stock market, there are many voices calling for measures to be taken for companies that have not submitted audit reports to protect investors. Currently, listed companies are not subject to separate sanctions if they disclose only the reasons for the delay on the day of the submission deadline.However, if the audit results are not disclosed on the same day even after being submitted to an external auditor, it is designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to delayed disclosure.According to the exchange, audit opinion was the most inappropriate among the main reasons for delisting related to settlement of accounts in recent years from last year to last year.Lee Kuk-chul, head of the Korea Exchange's disclosure team, said, ""Because simple accounting is delayed or audit reports submitted within the deadline may cause problems, there are no other restrictions other than announcing the reasons for delay through self-announcement.

"Ant investors who have invested about 100 million won in evaporation companies in one day are crying. If the listing is delisted, the stock will become a scrap of paper through liquidation sales. Stocks remain in stock accounts, but no value is recognized. There are also forces that mislead investors because there are cases where prices temporarily rise once the asking price comes out the next day when the clearance sale begins.According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, the monthly settlement corporation's submission of business reports last year caused the reason for delisting in the total opening of the securities market and KOSDAQ. Among them, KOSPI's opening, including Gyeongnam Company, Samhwan Company, and Shinil Construction, and Ultra Engineering & Construction listed on the KOSDAQ market were confirmed and began to be sold in a liquidated manner.As Gyeongnam Enterprise and Shinil Construction were judged to reject the audit opinion while the entire capital was eroded, Samhwan Enterprise was confirmed to be delisted on the coming day due to the full capital erosion. These three listed companies will have liquidation sales from that day to the day.The stock price of Kyungnam Company is higher than before the suspension of trading. It quickly became a coin stock as it was traded at the missing won. Minority shareholders with less than a stake in the company were named as of the end of last year, and their shares were Manchuria, which is equivalent to the total stake. In other words, minority shareholders lost about KRW 100 million in a day.Shinil Construction and Samhwan Corporation also fell out on the first day of the liquidation sale, respectively. The minority shareholder of Shinil Construction holds Manju, and the Samhwan company also has Manju. The value of the shares that were reduced on the same day is 100 million won, respectively.Ultra Engineering & Construction, a KOSDAQ-listed company, has been trading in order from the past to the coming day after being rejected by the audit opinion in a state of full capital erosion. Minority shareholders of the company are the sole proprietors of all shares.KOSDAQ-listed companies subject to delisting should also prove that the reason for delisting has been resolved or submit business reports by the coming day. Some listed companies may file an objection within days from the date of notification of the reason for delisting.Ujeon & Handan Steel & Resources Co., Ltd. of Codes Combine, etc. must prove the reason for the rejection of audit opinions due to uncertainty of continuing companies, and Seunghwa Pretech Wise Power Co., Ltd. should submit a business report. Youngjin Corporation had a number of reasons, including the erosion of the entire amount of capital that was not submitted in the business report that rejected the audit opinion.Among them, Happy Dream filed an objection last month. The exchange will hold a corporate review committee meeting within days of filing an objection, deliberate on whether to close it, and make a final decision within days of deliberation.

"KOSDAQ-listed companies are on the verge of exiting the stock market due to improper capital erosion of audit opinions that have not submitted business reports.In addition, new changes are designated in management stocks and investor ventilation stocks, respectively, requiring investors to pay attention.As a result of the Korea Exchange's review of the companies subject to submission of business reports among monthly settlement corporations for business years in the KOSDAQ market, all corporations with reasons for delisting were changed. This is the same size as last year.In particular, L Energy, Wise Power, Sublimation Pretech, and others did not submit business reports until the afternoon of the previous day, the deadline for submission, causing reasons for the funeral. If they do not submit a final business report by the coming day, they will go into the process of delisting.The newly designated corporation for management stocks is similar to the previous year, but the number of corporations that canceled management stocks increased compared to the previous year due to the relocation.Newly incorporated into investor-ventilated stocks was also similar in size to the previous year, and the number of companies that lifted investor-ventilated stocks increased compared to the previous year.As of this day, the designated corporation for management stocks in the KOSDAQ market is the designated corporation for ventilation stocks of investors.

"Stock prices of companies that have not submitted audit reports, including Woowon & Handan, are plunging together.As of 1 a.m., Ujeon & Handan was trading at the won, down KRW from the previous day.In addition, Acupix MJB biosign CNU is also falling.Audit reports must be attached to business reports because external auditors' audit opinions are included. Therefore, not submitting an audit report also means that there is a high possibility that a business report within the limit will not be able to be submitted.Listed companies are required to submit business reports containing audit opinions to the Financial Services Commission and the exchange within days after the business year. Monthly settlement corporations must pay by the end of this month.If a listed company does not submit a business report that has not been submitted by the end of this month, it will be designated as a management item the day after the deadline. If a business report is not submitted within the day after being designated as a management item, it will be delisted.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, among listed companies in the securities market, Gwanghui REITs, Shinwoo, and Gyeongnam Enterprise have not submitted audit reports so far.The KOSDAQ-listed corporation listed companies such as Wise Power's Wooseon & Handan Codes Combine, NRK PLC, Edubox, L Energy Ace Hi-Tech Acupix, MJB BioSign, Zalman Tech, and Seunghwa Pretech, which did not submit an audit report.Journalist Roh Jeong-dong of Hankyung Dotcom.

"Although the submission of business reports on the KOSDAQ market has been closed for the year, there are still companies that have not submitted them, so it is expected that there will be a sharp wind of delisting. There are many voices that the funeral is imminent, given that they were designated as management items in the past due to large-scale operating deficits and not holding regular shareholders' meetings. Companies that do not submit business reports are automatically incorporated into management items and are immediately withdrawn from the stock market if they do not submit their final business reports even during a one-day grace period.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, the total number of monthly settlement corporations that caused the KOSDAQ market to be closed is the total. Among them, companies such as L Energy, Sublimation, Pretek, Wise Power, and others are in danger of being closed due to failure to submit business reports until the deadline for submitting business reports.The companies have not submitted audit reports, and the possibility of delisting is raised as they pass the deadline for submitting business reports. According to the regulations, unlike audit reports submitted by each listed company only a week before the regular shareholders' meeting, business reports must be submitted by all listed companies in a lump sum by the month. Reporter Jang Min-kwon, copyright holder, Financial News. No unauthorized re-distribution"
"A day before the deadline for submitting the business report by the end of this month, it was found that some listed companies have not yet submitted audit reports.Companies that delay submitting audit reports are often delisted due to inadequate audit opinions or financial insolvency, raising the risk of being expelled from the stock market.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, KOSDAQ-listed companies such as Wise Power Ujeon & Handan NK L Energy Ace Hi-Tech Acupix, Jalman Tech, Sublimation Pretech, Steel & Resources Ultra Construction, have yet to submit an audit report. Listed companies in the securities market have already submitted all but Gyeongnam companies, which are confirmed to be delisted due to the erosion of all their capital.Although it is not sanctioned for exceeding the deadline for submitting an audit report a week before the general shareholders' meeting, if the audit report is not submitted by this month, it will itself be a reason for delisting.If you do not submit it within the day after being designated as a management item next month, you will be kicked out without being given 10 days if you have not submitted quarterly reports more than three times over the past year.Just as Codes Combine, which passed the deadline for audit reports, was immediately subject to delisting after being rejected by an external auditor on the past day, the delay in submitting reports is usually a sign of problems for companies. As it is a preliminary sign that there are many points pointed out by external auditors or requests for additional data, it is highly likely to be confirmed as inappropriate, such as rejection or restriction of audit opinions.

"A number of KOSDAQ-listed companies have failed to submit audit reports that officially disclose the performance of companies' business activities. Many of the companies in question are likely to lose operating losses for more than years since last year, requiring investors to pay attention.According to the electronic disclosure of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, all KOSDAQ-listed companies that have not submitted annual audit reports until this day are located. This figure is nearly doubled compared to last year's case.In particular, on the previous day, listed companies poured out delays in submitting audit reports. This is because the submission period was not met due to the regular shareholders' meeting of the monthly settlement corporations, which is the last thing to come.Most of them fail to submit their report cards on time due to poor performance. If the deficit continues and is designated as a management item by the exchange, the company's image and stock prices will fall significantly, forcing all-out efforts to make financial statements. In fact, except for Iljin Power, which lacked physical time after material division, most of them are struggling to handle accounting because they cannot prevent chronic deficits.In the case of biosigns, if a deficit occurs until this year, operating losses will occur continuously for the opening business year, which will be on the verge of being designated as a management item. Wise Power, which has already been designated as a management item, cannot prevent the delisting of the KOSDAQ market if operating losses continue until last year. The fate of the company depends on the results of this audit report.Seunghwa Pretech, which had applied to the court for approval for rehabilitation due to deficits for consecutive years, has yet to submit an audit report. Currently, the company has signed a merger and acquisition before the rehabilitation authorization, but the possibility that the audit results will affect the contract cannot be ruled out.In addition, Edubox Codes Combine Woojeon & Handan PL A Acupix has passed the set deadline.An accounting firm official said, ""Most listed companies that did not submit audit reports were asked to submit supplementary data,"" adding, ""Most listed companies that are likely to be delisted or designated as management items due to worsening financial conditions.""

"Prior to the deadline for submitting the business report at the end of the month, the submission of the audit report by the monthly settlement corporation was completed. However, it is pointed out that investors need to pay attention to the company because the listed corporation has not yet submitted an audit report. This is because companies that have not submitted audit reports are likely to be delisted or designated as management items. According to the Korea Exchange on the date of not submitting an audit report, including Kwanghee REITs and Gyeongnam Companies, among listed companies in the securities market, Kwanghee REITs, Shinwoo and Gyeongnam companies have not submitted an audit report so far.The KOSDAQ-listed corporation, Iljin Power Wise Power Woojeon & Handan Codes Combine, NRK PLC Edubox L Energy Ace Hi-Tech Acupix MJB BioSign, Zalman Tech, and Seunghwa Pretech, were listed on the list of companies that did not submit audit reports. Among KONEX listed corporations, FREKCO is not submitting an audit report.Audit reports must be attached to business reports because external auditors' audit opinions are included. Therefore, not submitting an audit report also means that there is a high possibility that a business report within the limit will not be able to be submitted.Listed companies are required to submit business reports containing audit opinions to the Financial Services Commission and the exchange within days after the business year. Monthly settlement corporations must pay by the end of this month.If a listed company does not submit a business report that has not been submitted by the end of this month, it will be designated as a management item the day after the deadline. If a business report is not submitted within the day after being designated as a management item, it will be delisted.In particular, investors need to pay special attention to companies that have not submitted quarterly business reports within the legal deadline for more than once in recent years because they will be delisted immediately if they do not submit them by this month. In other words, it will immediately go through the delisting process without designating a management item. Historical statistics show that companies that do not submit audit reports are likely to be delisted due to the high probability of delisting companies that do not submit audit reports. In recent years, the proportion of delisting related to settlement of accounts, such as the capital erosion of audit opinions, has been on the rise, and it was only among all delisting companies in the year, but it has increased until last year.Among them, companies that were delisted due to inappropriate reasons for audit opinions such as rejection of opinions took over. Non-appropriateness of the audit opinion corresponds to the reason for immediate dismissal.Companies that have not submitted audit reports so far are more likely to have reasons for delisting, such as inappropriate audit opinions. This is because from the perspective of external auditors, most of them require supplementary data because there are many suspicious parts in the financial statements of the company.Experts advise that investors should take a closer look at companies that have not submitted audit reports to avoid unintended losses.An official of the exchange said, ""Usually, companies that do not submit audit reports are often marginal companies,"" adding, ""Investors need to pay special attention to whether they comply with the deadline for submitting audit reports.""Meanwhile, liquidation related to settlement of accounts was concentrated in the KOSDAQ market. In recent years, KOSDAQ locations in the securities market have been closed for the same reason. More than half of both oil prices and KOSDAQ were delisted due to inappropriate reasons for audit opinions.Hankyung Dotcom Choi Sung Nam Roh Jeong-dong Reporter: No Reproduction and Redistribution of Hankyung Dotcom Unauthorized Reproduction"

However, there has been a problem that this procedure delays the rapid delivery of disclosure and sticks to the passive disclosure practices of listed corporations.Accordingly, the exchange introduced a system last year that exempts only corporations with excellent disclosure and blue-chip corporations that do not have reasons for disqualification within recent years.On the other hand, listed companies on the KOSDAQ, including Steel & Resources, Woojeon & Handan, Taechang Paros, GT&T Reneco, Acupix Polyvision, were designated as ventilation items for investors.

"Sentence Taechang Paros, which is undergoing a substantive review on the abolition of the graphic designer Yoo Jeong-soo's listing in the image area, has signed a stock transfer contract related to the change of the largest shareholder. Attention is focusing on whether the search for a new owner, which has failed several times, will succeed.In addition, as a company designated as a management item, it is concerned that major shareholders could be changed to unclear investment entities while screening is underway.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, former CEO Kim Seo-ki of MOS Industrial Co., Ltd. signed a stake transfer agreement with Choi Deok-hwan, which entails a change in the largest shareholder. The number of shares in the transfer is the total amount of shares held by Moss Industrial Co. and is 10,000 shares. The price per share is KRW, and the total transfer price is KRW 100 million.Taechang Paros is a famous beer franchise restaurant called Jjokchok. In addition, it has brands such as maple leaf kimbap, a kimbap restaurant, and Hwatu, a cooking bar.Taechang Paros is at a crossroads to delist as its performance continues to decline due to the economic recession and former CEO Kim's alleged embezzlement. The decision was made to be subject to a substantive examination of the eligibility for listing when former CEO Kim was indicted by the prosecution last month on charges of embezzling billions of won.The company's consolidated operating profit was KRW 100 million per year, but it turned into a deficit to KRW 100 million in annual operating losses and expanded to KRW 100 million in losses.Taechang Paros has been steadily looking for people subject to management rights and stake sales, but it has repeatedly failed. In the same month, Kolon Tourism signed a contract for a total of 100 million won to change management rights, but the contract was terminated due to the failure of the buyer's contract in the same month.In the same month, Segyeong Construction was selected as the preferred bidder by conducting an open sale, but the negotiations broke down in the same year. It is known that conditions such as prices did not meet. The public sale was included in Taechang Paros' management improvement plan to get out of the delisting crisis, so when this part was canceled, shareholders complained that the delisting was neglected and only caused damage to ants.The amount offered by Taechang Paros in the signing of the stock transfer contract is also higher than the stock price before the trading was suspended, so it is questionable whether the actual balance can be paid. In addition, unlike before, it is concerned that there is insufficient information on it because the person who transfers stocks is an individual.The company said the price was decided by the two sides in consultation, adding that Choi Deok-hwan is expected to participate in management after the contract is implemented. It is only known to the market that Choi is the CEO of Woosung S&G Co., Ltd. and vice chairman of Changtu.The car sales price is a total of 100 million won, which is to be paid within the month. The remaining car sales must be paid within the coming month.Meanwhile, the exchange added additional reasons for the real examination based on regulations regarding Taechang Paros' signing of a stock transfer contract involving a change in major shareholders. This is because unintended damage to shareholders could occur if major shareholders cash in billions of won while the transaction is designated as a management item and the transaction is suspended.The improvement period is scheduled to end at the end of this month. Afterwards, when a company submits a statement of implementation of the improvement plan to the exchange, the exchange will evaluate its eligibility for listing once again and review it before deciding whether to delist.Reporter Kim Sung Eun...Real-time News Money Today, where copyright holders' money is visible, cannot be reproduced or redistributed without permission"

"There are also companies that exceed the erosion rate of exit crisis in Namgwang Construction and other places, and capital erosion companies are continuing with the settlement of the fiscal year about a month ahead. If capital erosion continues for more than a year or falls into a state of full capital erosion, it is immediately withdrawn from the stock market, so attention should be paid to investment.According to the Korea Exchange, listed companies that are currently in a state of complete capital erosion as a result of internal settlement are Namkwang Construction, Samhwan Corporation, and Shinil Construction.An exchange official said, ""If these companies fail to resolve the complete capital erosion through capital reduction or capital expansion by next month, they will be automatically withdrawn from the stock market,"" adding, ""Unlike the reasons for annual delisting, capital erosion is evaluated in half.""Capital erosion means that the company's deficit has widened due to sluggish operations, running out of retained earnings and starting to forget paid-in capital. Full capital erosion refers to a situation in which the cumulative deficit continues to rise and the capital is completely bottomed out.Investment in potential risk stocks that are likely to be designated as managed items due to partial capital erosion this year should also be careful. At the time of the internal settlement, stocks that are feared to be designated as management items beyond the capital erosion rate are Dongbu Steel & Resources Taechang Paros, Sublimation Pretech Orient, etc. If the state of capital erosion continues for more than a year, it is also a reason for delisting.An official from the financial investment industry pointed out, ""Since partial capital erosion companies are generally unable to raise funds normally, they are likely to shake off losses through large-scale free capital cuts and escape the risk of exiting the stock market.""In fact, Dongyang Eastern Network, TNC, Hyundai Cement, and Hyundai Paint, which were designated as management stocks last year due to partial capital erosion or were on the verge of delisting due to full capital erosion, all carried out large-scale free reductions. As of the end of the quarter of last year, all of these companies have overcome concerns over capital erosion.Reporter Park Joon-seok..."

"Reporter Kang Hyun-chang's small paid-in capital increase of deficit companies is on the rise. Industry analysts say that cash-strapped companies are taking advantage of the fact that they do not have to submit securities reports to the authorities for paid-in capital increase of less than 100 million won.According to the electronic disclosure of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, listed corporations in all locations have implemented paid-in capital increase of less than KRW 100 million one after another this year. During the same period last year, companies in total carried out such a small capital increase.In the case of KOSPI corporation, it is the change of company such as Unichem and Bohaejo Transmal Asia Holdings that conducted a small capital increase this year. The KOSDAQ corporation is a new company such as YJBrix, Taechangparos, Japan Business Development, Entipia ST Cube, New Pride Corporation, and Kumsung Tech Energy Solutions.Among them, Ilkyung Industries and Energy Solutions are paid-in capital increase in self-allocation, which is not much related to ordinary investors, but the problem is the paid-in capital increase in general public offerings involving ordinary investors.Most recently, YJ Bricks, which conducted a general public offering donation on the last day, raised a total of KRW 100 million in paid-in capital increase. The subscription rate hit .YJ Bricks previously attempted to make a bequest on Monday, but the stock was not issued as the designated transaction was suspended as an unfaithful disclosure corporation that day.There was a paid-in capital increase for Taechang Paras. Initially, the company tried to secure KRW 10 million in paid-in capital increase for general public offerings, but it only raised KRW 10 million as the subscription rate stopped.Antipia also conducted a paid-in capital increase on last month. The subscription rate has raised millions of won.In addition, UniChem raised billions of won in compensation, billions of won by ST Cube, and billions of won by Geumseong Tech, with a paid-in capital increase of less than 100 million won without the obligation to submit a securities report.New Pride Corporation also attempted to donate 100 million won, but it raised 100 million won in subscription rates, and Transmal Asia Holdings also offered to donate 100 million won. It increased its subscription rate by 100 million won worth of stocks.Among them, YJBRICS and Taechang Paros Entopia are regular corporations that conducted paid-in capital increase of less than KRW 100 million during the same period last year.In the case of YJ Bricks, it continued its operating loss for years from last year to last year, and succeeded in turning into a surplus in the year, but later returned to the red. Last year, it posted operating losses of 100 million won until the quarter, and net losses of 100 million won and 100 million won each until the quarter.Taechang Paros continued to lose until the quarter of last year after making an operating loss of KRW 100 million. Net loss is 100 million won each.In particular, YJBrix and Taechang Paros are close to the standard for designating management items not only for deficits but also for cumulative penalties for violating disclosure obligations.NTPIA's operating profit continues to occur, but its net loss continues from year to year.In fact, among the corporations that have made a bequest of less than 100 million won this year, all of them are in the red, except for the Bohaejo.An official at a securities firm said, ""Small capital increase, which is exempted from the obligation to submit securities reports, is often used by corporations with weak financial structure,"" adding, ""We should be especially careful about general public offering investments without major shareholders or students.""

"Happy Dream's operating profit last year is expected to break away from the surplus management stocks compared to the previous year. Unison KDC is also paying attention to the performance of management stocks that are at the crossroads of delisting in the expected quarter.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Happy Dream announced the previous day that its operating profit turned into a surplus year-on-year with KRW 100 million last year. During the same period, the net loss also decreased to KRW 100 million.Happy Dream has been included in the management category for the past year in a row. However, it is expected that it will be able to avoid delisting as well as escape from the management category as it emerged from the operating deficit based on individual standards last year. An official of Happy Dream said, ""We succeeded in turning into a surplus last year by restructuring insolvent businesses such as corporate supermarkets and transportation businesses,"" adding, ""We expect to break away from management stocks this year.""According to the Korea Exchange, KOSDAQ-listed companies such as Happy Dream will enter management stocks if the operating profit deficit continues for each consecutive year and be delisted if the deficit continues for a consecutive year. In addition, if sales are less than 100 million won, if management stocks continue for a consecutive year, they will be delisted. Even if the loss of business continuing to deduct corporate tax costs above equity capital continues more than once in recent years, if the same situation continues after the management item, it will lead to delisting. If the capital erosion rate is higher than that, if the management item is completely capital erosion, it will be delisted.Currently, the total number of stocks designated as management items is including Happy Dream and some preferred stocks. This month, Shinwoo Dongbu Engineering & Construction's Steel & Residence Green Cross Holdings was newly designated as a management item.In the case of Unison, which had been in the red for two consecutive years, cumulative operating profit in the quarter of last year turned into a surplus compared to the previous year, and expectations for breaking away from management stocks are high.

"P&Tel, a mobile phone case parts maker, appointed a former Samsung Electronics executive as its management manager last month but dismissed him earlier this year. This is because an important contract that determines the improvement of the company's management failed. He later appointed a new management manager this month, but dismissed him again after a month and a half due to his lack of management skills. Last month, the Korea Exchange decided to delist P&Tel in consideration of its continuity and transparency in management. Currently, an improvement period has been granted in response to the objection.The recruitment of management managers of KOSDAQ-listed companies is continuing this year as well. The management manager is a place where companies that have suffered from management disputes due to poor performance give the authority of CEO to seek normalization of management, and there is virtually no legal basis. Financial supervisory authorities and legal experts have joined forces to call for caution in investing in companies that overuse management manager cards, which are cited as one of the causes of corporate insolvency.According to the electronic disclosure of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, KOSDAQ-listed companies that appointed management managers this year were all new companies, including P&T, Geumseong Tech, Taechang Paros, Digitech System, and MJB.Digitech Systems, which is set to decide whether to delist in the coming month, appointed a management manager last month in the name of normalizing management and implementing restructuring after former management was put on trial for embezzlement and breach of trust earlier this year.KOSDAQ company MJB, which has been rumored to have evaporated its largest shareholder's stake, appointed a management manager last month by Taechang Paros, who was given a management improvement period until next month.Legal experts point out that there is no legal basis to rationalize management managers. An official of the Korean Bar Association pointed out that, in principle, there is no prestigious basis, and the location of responsibility is unclear, and that it is common to reverse responsibility based on advantages and disadvantages as marginal companies take out their management manager cards.It has strong authority, such as being delegated by the CEO, but it is abused as a means to pretend that it was done without authority when faced with a disadvantageous situation or to put the responsibility of poor management of marginal companies.Supervisory authorities are also keeping an eye on the management manager issue. However, there is no excuse to directly sanction matters related to individual corporate management. According to an analysis of companies that appointed management managers in the past by the Financial Supervisory Service, half of them disappeared from the stock market as they were designated as management items or delisted within a year.An FSS official said, ""The legal basis and scope of responsibility, such as being appointed by the board of directors without a resolution at a shareholders' meeting, are causing insolvency of listed companies due to abuse of authority or illegal activities.""Reporter Jung Joonyoung...

In recent years, demand for electronic smartphones has increased, breaking away from the deficit for the first time in years, generating hundreds of millions of won in sales and net profit of hundreds of millions of won.CEO Kim said, ""All companies incorporated into the management category are difficult, but I think Turbo Tech has better conditions and opportunities than any other company,"" adding, ""We will normalize the company as soon as possible and introduce new technology-oriented businesses to become blue-chip companies.""Choi Seok-hwan: Real-time News Money Today, where the copyright holder's money can be seen, cannot be reproduced or redistributed without permission"

In the case of , the number of potatoes was reduced twice this year alone.According to the Korea Exchange, the previous day, the company decided to reduce the percentage of all shareholders' shares to be merged into the same face-to-face shares. Perhaps because of this fact being known in advance, stock prices closed lower than the previous day.The reason for the reduction is the improvement of the financial structure through deficit compensation. In fact, the business environment has deteriorated to the point where it recorded operating losses last year and the year before. Last month, the company decided to cut its losses as well, and the stock plunged to its lower limit the next day. The current stock price fell compared to before the announcement of the decision last month. Shareholders are bound to lose money because stock prices usually fall after the decision to reduce the capital.However, as recently, more and more companies are deciding on capital cuts due to improved financial structure. In the previous month, we were the only company that decided on potatoes. This month, more than half of the month, two more potato decisions were announced. It is Daesung Industrial and KM&C. In the case of Daesung Industrial, the stock price fell during the trading day until the previous day after the announcement on the last day.The reason why companies' disclosure of decision-making on reduction is attributed to the risk of being designated as a management item or delisting if the financial structure is not improved at the end of the year. An official from the financial investment industry said, ""Limited companies are going to improve their financial structure to avoid the delisting of listed companies, such as complete capital erosion or KOSDAQ-listed companies' operating profit deficit for a consecutive year."" In fact, KMR&C, which decided to reduce capital this time, was designated as a management item last month due to reasons such as higher capital erosion rates.Investors are required to pay attention as there is a high possibility that additional disclosures of decision-making will continue ahead of the year-end settlement. In particular, investors are expected to have to carefully examine their business reports and quarterly earnings to be released this time, as it could lead to delisting if it has already been designated as a management item.Meanwhile, the total number of stocks currently designated as management items is including preferred stocks. Ultra Engineering & Construction Unichem Rocket Electric Jway, Nexolon, Taechang Paros, Shinwoo, Seunghwa Pretech, E-Korea REITs, etc. have been designated as management items in the second half of this year.

"Meritz Securities said Apple is likely to adopt sapphire materials rather than gorilla glass as a cover material for the iPhone in the second half of the year, estimating that Apple's current supplier has secured about 1,000 sapphire ingot manufacturing equipment, and judged that it is more likely to be applied to premium models than fully.Apple's adoption of sapphire covers is expected to expand rapidly to other smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics, and its marketing strategy that it can be free from scratch and damage problems without protective film is attractive enough. In this case, Samsung Electronics diagnosed that phased application of Galaxy series derivatives with low sales volume will be a realistic strategy.Considering that the market size of cathode active materials for secondary batteries is almost trillion won, the global supply capacity of sapphire ingot is 100 million won, and the annual demand for sapphire based on smartphone is more than double the amount of usage.Meanwhile, Meritz Securities selected Hansol Technics as the top pick stock, seeing the prerequisite for the growth of Sapphire's smartphone cover market as supply capacity, not price.

Hansol Technics is expected to continue its quarterly earnings surplus and profit growth in the second half due to strong demand in the short term, and its solar and dragon power module businesses are also expected to maximize benefits in the long run when Samsung Electronics adopts sapphire.Meanwhile, Sapphire Technology is expected to turn into a surplus in the second half of the year due to increased sales of Sapphire for Apple fingerprint recognition home button and camera module cover and increased demand for Sapphire based on differentiated manufacturing competitiveness.

"Investors are required to pay attention as there are many stocks that can be kicked out of the stock market depending on the performance of listed companies ahead of the announcement of their performance in the company. The Korea Exchange designates it as a management item if sales do not meet a certain level or more in accordance with the listing regulations. If the performance continues to be sluggish the following year, it will be delisted. Therefore, if the annual performance falls below the performance required by the exchange depending on the quarterly performance this year, there is a possibility that it will be designated as a management item and even kicked out of the stock market.According to the Korea Exchange on the day of whether management items will be designated due to poor performance, KOSPI-listed companies will be designated as management items if their sales do not reach 100 million won for a year. If sales are less than 100 million won for consecutive years, it will eventually be delisted.In the case of KOSDAQ-listed companies, if their sales are less than KRW 100 million for consecutive years, they will be withdrawn from the stock market even if they record operating losses for consecutive years.KOSPI-listed companies recorded sales of KRW 100 million by the quarter of last year, and if their quarterly sales do not exceed KRW 100 million immediately, they will be designated as management stocks due to lack of sales.The company managed to avoid being designated as a management item by recording sales of 100 million won in the year. Considering that the company's sales have fallen from 100 million won to nearly 100 million won over the past year, it is not reassuring. Among KOSDAQ-listed companies, there are listed companies that are likely to be designated as management items due to a lack of sales. Until the quarter of this year, companies have not met the sales conditions required to maintain their listings.Barunson E&A AMINOLOGICES Crystal Byromed and others are the same.Listed companies that have been driven to the edge of the cliff are at least designated as management stocks, but they can break away from management stocks if they recover their performance throughout the year. On the other hand, many KOSDAQ-listed companies will be kicked out immediately if they record operating losses until this year.Although E-Korea REITs Co-Creb is a KOSPI-listed company designated as a management item last year because its fiscal year sales did not meet 100 million won, all of these companies are monthly settlement corporations.Among KOSDAQ-listed companies, the listed companies that recorded operating losses for the previous year in a row and were designated as management items include NRK, Natural and Environmental Happy Dream, Unison Friesen, and others.Among them, NK is currently suspended from trading. The exchange announced on the last day that it will decide within days whether to delist NK.The most dangerous listed company was Frizen, which had an operating loss of 100 million won until the quarter of last year. If quarterly operating profit does not cover the deficit, it is inevitable to amortize. The deal is currently suspended.Even Happy Dream cannot be relieved. It recorded operating profit of KRW 100 million until the quarter, and will be kicked out if its operating loss exceeds its cumulative operating profit in the quarter. On the other hand, Nature and Environment Unison's operating profit is more than KRW 100 million until the quarter, so if there is no large operating loss in the quarter, it can avoid liquidation. .

"The KOSPI index gave up the line in the aftermath of the Swiss central bank's abolition of the minimum exchange rate system. Global risks overlapped with concerns over quarterly earnings, leading to a large outflow of foreign funds.Stock market experts predicted that the horizontal trend will continue for the time being as the expansion of external variables strengthens the preference for safe assets and there are no additional drivers such as policy momentum in the local stock market.Park Sang-hyun, a researcher at Hi Investment & Securities, explained that the abolition of Switzerland's minimum exchange rate system and the subsequent fall in the U.S. stock market have increased preference for safe assets and reduced attractiveness to emerging markets, including Korea. Baek Yoon-min, a researcher at Investment & Securities, said investors are not in a buying direction ahead of next week's monetary policy meeting in Greece, predicting that the wait-and-see stance is expected to continue until the external event is over.The KOSPI fell to the mid-day mark on the KOSPI from the previous day. close a deal on the drop of The KOSPI, which started with . on the same day, was pushed down the line by expanding its fall and recorded . at one point during the day.Foreign investors sold 100 million won on the same day alone, leading the decline.

Textiles, which fell from the previous day, fell to Cheil Industries, a component of the industry, and drew a downward curve.Stocks within the top market cap also recorded a bearish trend. Hynix and Samsung Life Insurance fell the most, respectively. While most of the KOSPI index's composition stocks also fell, Hyundai Hysco rose the most and Hyosung recorded a strong performance.On the KOSPI market, individual stocks, including individual stocks, closed higher.

"Sentence Jung Byung-hoon, asset management fund manager, Lee Kwan-woo, Asset Management managing director, Jung Jae-won, asset management fund manager.With the KOSPI recording a negative return since the beginning of the year, the long-short fund fund manager is drawing attention for his stable return. Amid sluggish returns on large-sized long-short funds with a set amount of more than KRW 100 million, the long-short fund stood out as it remained faithful to the nature of the long-short fund, which is medium-risk heavy profit.The first fund is Asset Management's Korea Long Short Fund, which was set up on last month. According to FnGuide, the fund's class-based rate of return is . . . which overcomes extreme market volatility and boasts a stable rate of return.The fund's manager is Chung Byung-hoon, who managed Merrill Lynch International's international hedge fund.Manager Chung said, ""We focused on avoiding flashy and volatile operations and pursuing stable profits,"" adding, ""It was effective to abandon excessive greed and select stocks that would generate profits within the same industry through careful stock research.""In the second half of this year, volatility was extreme, with the KOSPI index soaring to and plunging below the line again. It was a very difficult market to keep the return on any portfolio. Manager Chung achieved the result of beating the market mainly through fair trading in large-cap stocks.As a result, KRW 100 million was flowed into the Korea Long Short Fund compared to the beginning of the year, and it quietly exceeded the set amount of KRW 100 million.Another fund that overcame the roller coaster market is Asset Plus Happy Dream Together Fund of Asset Plus Asset Management. The fund's class-based return compared to the beginning of the year boasts faithful performance to the nature of the Long Short Fund.Lee Kwan-woo, managing director of Asset Plus Asset Management, said, ""We did our best to reduce the risk of investment judgment by investing in companies with a solid business model,"" explaining that KOSPI index futures, which were insured, defended their returns stably even when stock prices fell.Lee is mainly investing in large-cap stocks to prevent fund returns from rapidly changing due to market fluctuations. The key point is to select only companies such as each industry.Lee said investors can also feel safe if they invest in companies, such as being able to adapt well to the changing environment and lead the growing market. Asset Plus Happy Dream Together is currently recording a set amount of 100 million won as funds flowed in compared to the beginning of the year due to its solid performance.The new long short fund, which has attracted attention for its unique management style since it was set up last month, is a long short fund worth asset management. The fund is a product operated by Jung Jae-won, a fund manager from the Korea Value Asset Management public recruitment period, and added a short strategy to the value stock fund.The return on the value-added long shot class has been on record for the first time in months since its launch. This is a remarkable achievement compared to the fact that most of the domestic long-short funds' returns have been negative in recent months.Chung Jae-won, a fund manager of asset management, said, ""Basically, it is difficult for value-added funds to be free from the KOSPI's fall, but we wanted to launch a fund that compensates for these shortcomings.""Manager Chung, a disciple of Lee Chae-won, vice president of Korea Value Asset Management, who is a master of domestic value investment, also topped the return on domestic equity funds with small and medium-sized Korea funds last year.Reporter Oh Jung Eun...Real-time News Money Today, where copyright holders' money is visible, cannot be reproduced or redistributed without permission"

"Controversy is brewing over the effectiveness of the Korea Exchange's plan to advance listing withdrawal introduced to restore investor confidence in the year.It is a system that will be delisted if the operating deficit continues for consecutive years, but it is pointed out that separate financial statements that are used as criteria for withdrawal do not properly thin out marginal companies.In fact, many of the companies with exit warnings avoided the risk of delisting by shaking off insolvent businesses to subsidiaries or acquiring blue-chip companies rather than normal business activities. This is because the performance of consolidated companies such as subsidiaries has not been determined in separate financial statements. According to the Japanese financial investment industry in the new year, KOSDAQ companies, which recorded operating losses for consecutive years until last year, are new companies such as Electronics, Elcomtech, Unison, P&T, Happy Dream, Wise Power, and Nature and the Environment.Other than the former, which had already been scrapped due to bankruptcy last month, will be kicked out of the stock market if the operating deficit continues until this year.Among them, Gaega, excluding P&T, recorded a cumulative operating surplus in this quarter. If there is no massive loss in the quarter, it is likely to recover dramatically from the cliff edge. If a brokerage firm succeeds in escaping the crisis, it is the survival rate.This is different from last year when all of the companies in the candidate group, including M-Tech Vision, were scrapped when the first companies to leave the list were released as a way to advance the listing system.However, if you look into the inside of the company that revived, you can tilt your head. Rather than making money through actual business activities and going from deficit to surplus, it is because it is out of the worst situation as a result of removing and attaching blue-chip companies of insolvent companies.Last month, Nature and the Environment divided the steel business sector, which has been holding back its performance, and established its subsidiary, Nature and Environment Steel. It then decided to sell natural and environmental steel in the month. Thanks to the fact that the company dumped its poor business into its subsidiaries, it has recorded a cumulative surplus of 100 million won until the quarter of this year.An official of the company said, ""Natural and Environmental Steel is an accounting subsidiary, so it affects consolidated profit and loss, but it does not affect other subsidiaries,"" adding, ""After the sale, the steel sector was excluded from consolidated subsidiaries.""On the contrary, Happy Dream is a case of absorbing and merging profitable subsidiaries. The company, which had been in the red until the first half of the year, absorbed its subsidiary Hongik Infrastructure and actively collected accounts receivable, earning about 100 million won in operating profit in the quarter. The cumulative surplus is one hundred million won.An official of Happy Dream said, ""The merger and acquisition of Hongik infrastructure was a strategic decision,"" adding, ""We were able to turn into a quarterly surplus due to changes in receivables.""Wise Power also recorded an operating surplus until the quarter as it acquired the precision control division of Convex, the largest shareholder with a good business. The same method is possible for the Financial Services Commission to link international standards for financial statements separately because the terms of offsetting companies in operating deficits follow separate financial statements except for subsidiaries' performance.Since last year, companies' performance disclosure has been changed to a consolidated standard due to the mandatory application of consolidated financial statements, but the conditions for designating management items and closing of companies with operating deficits for consecutive years are based on a separate standard.The exchange says it is based on separate financial statements because the purpose of the advanced plan is to determine whether it can make profits and maintain its listing through actual business activities.However, it is pointed out that as a separate standard, insolvent companies can be used as an excuse to change their appearance to blue-chip companies or as a trap for black companies to be listed on the list of evictions.Among the companies that are on the verge of being kicked out, Wise Power and others are still in the red based on consolidated financial statements.On the contrary, in the case of last year, some of the companies listed on the management category turned into a surplus when considering consolidated financial statements.In this regard, the Financial Services Commission earlier decided to use the financial standards designated by external auditors as the basis for consolidated financial statements, not separately, in the amendment to the Enforcement Decree of the External Audit Act. This is because there is a concern about regulatory avoidance through transactions between consolidated companies if judged by separate financial statements.Yoon Joon-koo, an official at the Financial Services Commission's Capital Markets Bureau, said, ""If judged by separate financial statements, there is a risk of lowering the debt ratio through transactions with subsidiaries.""Yoon also said, ""The consolidated financial statements are offset by transactions between the parent company and its subsidiaries. For example, if the parent company makes money by selling goods to its subsidiaries, it is reflected in the financial statements separately, but not because the consolidated financial statements are viewed as one.""An accounting expert also said, ""If you want to see a comprehensive view of a company, it should be considered as a consolidated financial statement,"" adding, ""Korean companies often have overseas factories and corporations due to globalization. The position of the Korea Exchange is mixed with the Financial Services Commission as shareholders of the exchange's poor business reorganization have increased their growth potential. Jeong Ji-hun, head of the KOSDAQ disclosure team at the Korea Exchange, countered, ""If we take off the insolvent business, the remaining companies will be healthier and helpful to shareholders.""Chung said, ""If a company has such a system, it is meaningful because it has no choice but to continue to try to be sound,"" adding, ""The plan to advance the listing is aimed at thinning out business and financial loopholes.""An official from the financial investment industry said, ""When judging the status of a particular company on a separate basis, we have to carefully examine whether there are back-to-back contracts that have been transferred to the parent company or not made public.""Hankyung Dotcom Planning and Reporting Team.

"The KOSDAQ company, which recorded operating losses for consecutive business years on a separate basis until last year, is a new company such as Electronics, Elcomtech, Unison, P&Tel, Happy Dream Wise Power, nature, and environment.According to the Korea Exchange and the financial investment industry, the former was delisted due to bankruptcy this month.LCOMTECH Unison, P&T, Happy Dream, Wise Power, Nature and the Environment, etc., which still survive, will be kicked out of the stock market if they record an operating deficit again this year.Among them, the company has recorded a cumulative operating surplus for this quarter. However, P&T had a cumulative operating deficit until the quarter, turning on a red light.Prior to them, companies such as Widas M-Tech Vision, DIVES and Mysco, which had been on the brink of a business deficit for years in a row due to the implementation of an advanced listing system.M-Tech Vision was kicked out of the stock market for reasons of operating losses for the past year in a row, and Widas and Mysco were named from the stock market after being rejected for their audit opinions on the annual financial statements. DBS was expelled due to the rejection of audit opinions on its annual financial statements for the first year, showing that all companies with operating deficits were closed for the consecutive year. Survival rate. As this year enters the year of implementation of the system, companies have carried out preemptive work for survival over the years. Judging from the current situation, the survival rate of individual companies is expected to be. P&Tel's quarterly cumulative operating deficit, UMP&Tel, is in a bad situation again this year. It posted a continuous operating deficit in the quarter and recorded a cumulative operating loss of KRW 100 million until the quarter.We have to aim for dramatic performance improvement in the remaining quarter, but there is more urgent work. First of all, it must pass the substantive examination of the listing eligibility of the Korea Exchange. P&Tel has had its largest shareholder change since it was designated as a management item due to its operating deficit for consecutive years.If there is a change in management rights, management items must be reviewed whether they are subject to a substantive examination of listing eligibility. P&Tel was decided to be kicked out of the actual examination, but the objection was accepted and given an improvement period.The improvement period granted by the exchange will end on the coming day, and P&Tel must submit an expert's confirmation on the results of the improvement plan implementation within days from the end date. The exchange holds a listing committee within a day from the date of submission of documents to deliberate on whether to delist and decide whether to delist within a day from the date of deliberation.P&Tel sold its affiliates Humeric and Magna Investments one after another to put out the fire that fell on its feet. It is also planning to divide the mold division through a temporary shareholders' meeting on the coming day.If the results of the implementation of the improvement plan so far are not good, P&T can be kicked out of the stock market before receiving this year's performance. Excluding P&T, the company has recorded cumulative operating profit until this quarter. In order to maintain its status as a listed company, it is making all-out efforts by changing owners, merging surplus subsidiaries, or removing deficit business units.Elcomtech, which had an operating loss for consecutive years until last year, has been in the black since it was acquired by Partron. Partron acquired Hansung Elcomtech, which went under court receivership last year, and changed its name to Elcomtech.An official from Elcomtech explained, ""It has changed to a profitable structure by closing the camera lens module business and focusing on other mobile phone parts businesses such as sensors.""WisePower acquired the precision control division of Convex, the largest shareholder, this month. Both Wise Power and Convex representatives are Park Ki-ho. In addition, it recorded a cumulative operating surplus this quarter as a result of reorganizing its poor businesses such as battery and packaging that had not been profitable so far and reorganizing its structure around special lighting and precision control businesses.However, it is not safe to say that it is only a small amount of millions of won. The company expects the performance of the precision control business to increase.Happy Dream is also making all-out efforts to achieve annual operating profit. This month, it absorbed and merged Hongik Infrastructure, a profitable subsidiary, and actively collected uncollected payments.As a result, the company posted a deficit of about 100 million won until the first half of this year, but made an operating profit of about 100 million won in the quarter, resulting in a cumulative operating surplus of 100 million won. A company official said, ""We aim to achieve annual operating profit by selling sales bonds at a discount in the quarter.""Nature and the environment have pulled the deficit division apart. In this month, the steel business was divided and its subsidiary, Natural and Environmental Steel, was established. This is because the criteria for withdrawal due to operating deficits for consecutive years are separate financial statements, not consolidation. The subsidiary does not affect its performance separately. It is recording an operating surplus of 100 million won by the end of the quarter.Unison is recovering dramatically as wind power projects that were under way become visible. Until the first half of this year, the company went from operating loss of 100 million won to surplus of 100 million won.This is due to the completion of project financing for the construction of the Yeonggwang Baeksu Wind Power Complex. Last month, Unison won an order to supply and build wind power generators worth hundreds of millions of won to the Yeonggwang Baeksu Wind Farm. It has supplied wind power generation equipment by this month and plans to supply all of the equipment by the end of the year. It is expected that a significant portion of the order will be reflected by the end of this year.Hankyung Dotcom Planning and Reporting Team.

"The foggy Yeouido stock market saw listed companies designated as stocks of interest flock to the edge of the cliff by Shin Kun-woong, a reporter for the fear of delisting news management stocks. This is because the possibility of exit has increased due to the rejection of audit opinions and continued losses in operating capital erosion.Already, Hyundai Cement's financial situation worsened due to the failure of payment guarantees for Sungwoo Construction, causing reasons for delisting, and Rockets Electric Co. is also on the verge of being kicked out due to the rejection of its audit opinion.According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, failure to meet standards such as rejection of audit opinions or lack of business loss transactions due to capital erosion is a reason for delisting.The most dangerous stocks are companies that have already been designated as interested stocks. Companies that were once popular are now on the verge of being kicked out.Rocket Electric Co., Ltd. was rejected as a reason for delisting in its audit report for the business year and applied for corporate rehabilitation procedures last month, but was eventually notified of the abolition. It is known that the court is considering reapplying, but the results are difficult to be confident.Nexon is also under court receivership for refusing audit opinions and plans to submit a corporate rehabilitation plan.Shinwoo, a leather company, also went through rehabilitation procedures due to unfaithful disclosure and rejection of audit opinions. Since then, it has been sold to Kyungwon Industries, but it is difficult to guarantee the future.UniChem was also designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation this year alone and received a limited ruling on separate financial statements and related audit opinions in the first half of this year.In addition, Rich Country Consignment REITs, Jway, and Digitec System are also likely to be delisted after being diagnosed with inappropriate or rejection in their audit opinions.Capital erosion is also making stocks of interest anxious. This is because as the deficit increased, the company's surplus ran out and even began to forget its capital, which became a reason for its exit. According to the exchange, if the entire capital erosion takes place at the end of the recent business year or exceeds the capital erosion rate for half a year in a row, it will be delisted.Dongyang and Dongyang Networks Hyundai Cement TCC & Co. Hyundai Cement KMR&C has been designated as a management item due to capital erosion. Wow, the engine heavy industry is also in danger due to limited audit opinions and capital erosion. However, Hyundai Cement Engine, Dongyang Dongyang Networks and other companies submitted documents proving the reason for resolving the entire capital erosion.KOSDAQ-listed companies are also burdened with operating losses. The KOSDAQ market will be designated as a management stock if operating losses continue for consecutive business years and delisted for consecutive years.The stocks designated as management stocks due to operating losses for consecutive years are Wise Power, Nature, Environment, P&T, Happy Dream, Unison, Frizen, and Elcomtech. Among them, Wise Power and P&T Prisen are companies whose business performance is negative until the quarter.In addition, KDC and Osung LST Playwith New Pride Wise Power KM&C Daesung Eltech Veritas KPMTECH ICXC General Capital LCOMTECH will be a reason for delisting if business losses exceed their equity capital once again.In addition, Jalman Tech Youngjin Corporation Ultra Construction, Taechang Paros, Seunghwa Pretech, Dongyang Cement, E-Korea REITs, Hyundai Mobis, Pyeongsan Car Industry, and Shinil Construction are designated as management items.An official at a securities firm, who asked not to be named, warned that investors should be extra careful not to suffer losses as the settlement date approaches, saying that management stocks are likely to be delisted."

"Reporter Kang Hyun-chang's succession of MS Autotech's management rights has been completed. Through the paid-in capital increase, the largest shareholder has changed from the existing founder Lee Yang-seop to his son, CEO Lee Tae-kyu. However, dilution of equity has hurt ordinary investors.MS Autotech announced after the close of the market that its largest shareholder has changed from Lee Yang-sub to Lee Tae-gyu due to changes in shares caused by participation in the paid-in capital increase.MS Autotech is an automobile body parts manufacturer based on Myungshin Industries, which was established in last year. CEO Lee Tae-kyu, who rose to become the largest shareholder this time, is the son of founder Lee Yang-sup, the existing largest shareholder.Chairman Lee Yang-sup is known to have served as Hyundai Motor's president for the first time as a former public recruit and participated in the development of domestic Hocha Pony cars, and CEO Lee has been in charge of management since the year.CEO Lee Tae-kyu subscribed to Manchuria for the allocation of new shares in the event of a paid-in capital increase, and Chairman Lee Yang-sup, who was the largest shareholder, subscribed to Manchuria for the allocation of new shares and sold the rest of the new shares to Simwon, a related party. Simwon is a subsidiary of MS Autotech.CEO Lee Tae-kyu already had management rights as CEO, but through this bequest, he has acquired the largest shareholder status and secured a more stable position.Meanwhile, Lee rose to become the largest shareholder, but investors suffered losses.

Since then, he has discussed with Bosch Electric Power Co., Ltd. to revise the prerequisites for the establishment of a joint venture and started to buy cars publicly.In the car, the goal was to secure the holdings after the open purchase, and if the target was not met, all the purchases of the subscription were canceled. However, the car decided to eliminate the target and buy all the shares that were subscribed. It also decided not to proceed with additional public purchases related to joint ventures after the initial public purchase.Prerequisites for the establishment of a joint venture have also been lowered from to secure shares of the existing largest shareholder. If the company fails to secure its stake through this public purchase, the contract to establish a joint venture with Bosch will be automatically terminated.Bosch, which wants to voluntarily delist, lowered the conditions for the largest shareholder's stake to be lowered with a special resolution in mind.If Kyungchang Industry secures more than its stake, the two companies plan to transfer the project to the joint venture through a special resolution at the general shareholders' meeting. This is because the transfer of business is a matter of special resolution that must be approved by more than a minute of voting rights attending the general shareholders' meeting.In this case, it is highly likely to be subject to a substantial review of delisting as it falls under the suspension of major operations under the KOSDAQ market listing regulations.The open purchase of cars is to secure shares, but the actual goal is to acquire shares, which is a prerequisite for joint investment. The open purchase price is the same won per share as the car. Open purchase subscriptions are conducted through the headquarters and branches of investment securities.An official from Kyungchang Industry said, ""Bosch Electric Power Co., which produces wiper motors, has little growth in performance, and China is also facing low-cost attacks to produce wiper blades and arms,"" adding, ""The two companies are trying to compete in price by reducing production and fixed costs.""He added that if the listing is voluntarily delisted, it will also take protective measures for minority shareholders who have not responded to the public purchase.Han Min-soo, a reporter for Hankyung Dotcom.

"In partnership with Bosch of Germany, the world's largest auto parts maker, it will enter the vehicle wiper system market in earnest.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, it has decided to establish a joint venture, KBEfer System, through in-kind investment with Bosch, Germany.The capital of the joint venture is 100 million won, and the stake will be shared by Wabosh Electric Power Co., Ltd. In order to secure this stake, the company invests about KRW 100 million in spot assets such as factories. Regarding the background of the establishment of the joint venture, the company explained that it aims to strengthen competitiveness in the wiper industry by producing wiper systems.The main products of auto parts manufacturers are wiper-related parts such as wiper blades and arm ring gauges. As of last quarter, an abnormality in overall sales occurred in wiper-related parts.However, there was a limit to the manufacture of individual parts because it did not produce wiper motors, which are key parts of the vehicle wiper system. The wiper system consists of a wiper motor, a wiper link, a wiper arm, a wiper blade, and a cleaning fluid injection device.When a joint venture is established, it will be able to produce wiper systems collectively at domestic factories using Bosch's wiper motor production technology. The joint venture will design a wiper system for vehicles and operate manufacturing, sales and distribution businesses. An official said, ""We believe that entering the wiper system market through joint ventures is more efficient in terms of production and logistics costs than manufacturing independent motors,"" adding, ""We understand that Bosch has set up a joint venture to reduce labor costs.""Meanwhile, Kyungchang Industrial Co., the largest shareholder, has decided to voluntarily close its shares by buying them publicly to establish the joint venture. This is because the contract with Bosch will be finalized only when the stocks held by Kyungchang Industry and related parties are at least the total number of issued stocks.Kyungchang Industrial Co., Ltd. will purchase more than 10,000 shares through an open purchase of cars that will take place until next month to increase its holdings to more than that.The company said that the timing and size of the joint venture's production should be observed and the results of the open purchase have not been decided yet.Reporter Park Hee-jin of Hankyung Dotcom.

"Ahead of the shareholders' meeting, shares of related companies surged on news of Super Ant's disposal and acquisition. Ace Hi-Tech closed sharply on the news of Super Ant's disposal of shares, while Shinil Industries soared on the news of Super Ant's additional stake acquisition, which will compete with its largest shareholder.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, Ace Hi-Tech closed at the won lower than the previous day. After showing a sharp rise in the early stages of the market, it plunged to the lower limit on the news that Super Ant Choi Dae-seung sold a large number of shares, but ended sharply by slightly reducing the drop.On the same day, Choi Dae-seung reported to the Financial Supervisory Service that his holdings of Ace Hi-Tech shares fell from the existing ones to Manchuria by selling them in the market.On the other hand, Shinil Industrial Co., Ltd. showed a sharp rise in the market on news of Super Ant's acquisition of additional shares, but reduced its rise. It closed at the right.The news that Hwang Gwi-nam, who is pushing for a hostile merger and acquisition of Shinil Industries, acquired an additional stake in Shinil Industries was a positive factor.Hwang Gwi-nam, a shareholder of Shinil Industrial Co., announced on the same day that a special official acquired additional shares of Shinil Industrial Co., Ltd. and its holdings increased to Manchuria.Choi Eun, a shareholder of Eritre Basic, also known as another super ant, announced with a special official that shares of Eritre Basic in the market have decreased from the existing Manchuria to Manchuria.

"Choi Dae-seung's simple investment target stock is drawing attention to the background of Super Ant Choi Dae-seung, who mainly invests in less than won stocks called necessary copper coins for falling stocks, buying shares of Ace Hi-Tech.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Choi acquired an in-house stake in Ace Hi-Tech on the last day. The total purchase price is 100 million won. The acquisition has increased Choi's stake from the previous one to . Choi bought a stake in the company on the month of last year and has been repeating the accident and sale since then.Despite the news of Choi's acquisition of shares, Ace Hi-Tech compared to the previous day. We closed the deal at a drop in the won.Choi's side said, ""We have been buying low-priced stocks and continuing to invest in cash when stock prices rise,"" adding, ""We bought Ace Hi-Tech again this time for simple investment purposes.""The reason why news of Choi's stake purchase is drawing attention is because of the investment pattern he has shown so far. He has been making profits by investing in coins below the won and selling them when the stock price rises. In particular, he bought Manju at Won per share information and communication common stock in Daishin last month. Shares of Daishin Information and Communication nearly doubled in the past month and realized profits by selling all of its shares in the previous month. The unit selling price is won.However, investment experts advise that Choi should not expect the company's stock price to rise just because he bought a stake in Ace Hi-Tech. This is because Ace Hi-Tech's performance was sluggish last year, and its entry into the bio business, which has been prepared, has also failed. In fact, Ace Hi-Tech continued to suffer losses with operating losses of KRW 100 million last year.Ace Hi-Tech, an electronic component manufacturer, announced last month that it would acquire shares and management rights of Japanese bio company Kyoto Biopharma, but the stock trading contract was eventually destroyed because it did not pay R&D costs. When this was revealed, the stock price, which had exceeded the monthly level last year, collapsed to the won at the end of that year. In addition, on Monday last year, Kim Byung-joon, a creditor of the company, filed for bankruptcy with the Cheongju court. Since then, the stock trading transaction has been suspended until the date, and the Cheongju court rejected the bankruptcy application, and the stock trading transaction suspension has been lifted from the day.a winning reporter."

"Although the submission of business reports on the KOSDAQ market has been closed for the year, there are still companies that have not submitted them, so it is expected that there will be a sharp wind of delisting. There are many voices that the funeral is imminent, given that they were designated as management items in the past due to large-scale operating deficits and not holding regular shareholders' meetings. Companies that do not submit business reports are automatically incorporated into management items and are immediately withdrawn from the stock market if they do not submit their final business reports even during a one-day grace period.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, the total number of monthly settlement corporations that caused the KOSDAQ market to be closed is the total. Among them, companies such as L Energy, Sublimation, Pretek, Wise Power, and others are in danger of being closed due to failure to submit business reports until the deadline for submitting business reports. Youngjin Corporation also did not submit a business report amid reasons for delisting due to the erosion of its entire capital.The companies have not submitted audit reports, and the possibility of delisting is raised as they pass the deadline for submitting business reports. According to regulations, unlike audit reports that each listed company submits only a week before the regular shareholders' meeting, business reports must be submitted by all listed companies in a lump sum by the month.Moreover, the market's distrust has grown in that they have already been incorporated into the management category due to the designation of corporations that have not held regular shareholders' meetings or have failed to approve financial statements.In fact, the exchange demanded the disclosure of the inquiry into the theory of non-appropriateness of the audit opinion of Seunghwa Pretech the previous day, but an official of Seunghwa Pretech only repeated the answer that nothing has been confirmed so far as not received an audit report from an external auditor.Lee Kuk-chul, head of the Korea Exchange's disclosure team, said, ""Companies that do not submit business reports are usually not considered normal because of various unfavorable factors such as failure to approve large-scale operating losses and financial statements.""Meanwhile, among all the changes that caused the funeral, those such as Happy Dream Codes Combine, Woojeon & Handan Zalman Tech Ace Hi-Tech Steel & Resources, are on the verge of being kicked out due to inappropriate audit opinions such as rejection and restriction.

"Super ants, who are big-handed individual investors, are also busy with the general shareholders' meeting season. Those who want to vote against changing the articles of incorporation or appointing directors are in the midst of collecting votes from minority shareholders.At the shareholders' meeting of auto parts maker Movie Metal, Son Myung-wan, a super ant who owns a stake, will exercise his voting rights against the change in the articles of association. Taking this opportunity, it is highly likely to attempt hostile mergers and acquisitions against Samsung Precision, the largest shareholder. Sohn said, ""We plan to vote against the articles of association with small shareholders,"" adding, ""We are considering dismissing and taking over the CEO as the company seems to have implemented a shareholder-friendly policy but has turned its head against the introduction of a golden parachute.""When the company's recent articles of association on the agenda of the shareholders' meeting included strengthening the requirements for the appointment of directors and establishing a new retirement allowance for directors, it was angry at the golden parachute system."" Golden parachute is a representative strategy for hostile defense, and it is a way to increase the acquisition cost by promising in advance the right to receive a large amount of severance pay for a certain period of time when a director resigns before his term. ""We have already accepted the shareholders' proposal, including the expansion of cash dividends to shareholders, the purchase of treasury stocks, and revaluation of assets,"" said the company, adding, ""We can revise the articles of association on the day of the shareholders' meeting, so we will do our best to reflect shareholders' opinions.""Sohn Myung-wan also plans to make a hostile takeover bid if necessary, demanding that Dongwon Metal, which is a monthly settlement corporation and owns a stake, be expanded through shareholder proposals later this month.Park Young-ok, another super ant and well-known stock farmer, is scheduled to appear at the Iljo Gwang Leather Co., Ltd., the head of the Iljo-Kwang Leather Co., Ltd. of the Iljo-Ri Bicycle. In particular, it plans to oppose the change in the articles of association of Chogwang Leather, which holds a stake. It is explained that increasing the limit on issuance of bonds and convertible bonds with underwriting rights from 100 million won to 100 million won enables reckless issuance of corporate bonds, which is contrary to shareholder interests. Park also urged the rest of the companies to normalize their management and said directors who did not work hard to develop the company and enhance shareholder value could be sanctioned for violating their duty of election.Meanwhile, Hwang Gwi-nam, a super-ant who is pushing for hostile action against Shinil Industries, said, ""The situation has been at a disadvantage as the court has not accepted the request for provisional disposition for the bill. This is because Hwang's shareholder proposal was not adopted as an agenda at this shareholders' meeting. However, he said, ""I will vote against the re-election of Chairman Kim Young as an in-house director."" Hwang said he might not approve financial statements without a proper explanation of why he suddenly turned into an operating deficit last year, and that he would oppose the re-election of Kim Young, who is suspected of embezzlement and breach of trust because he did not disclose where the funds were raised.Hwang also chased Chairman Kim Young, the largest shareholder, to the chin as Milesstone, a related party, acquired shares and increased its stake to . He said the new company Milesstone aims to become the largest shareholder of Shinil Industries as the main body and to complete a complete management change, adding that it is attracting investment through Milesstone and plans to invest all its shares in kind in the long run. Super ants, who purchased shares for investment purposes, are also taking capital gains just before the shareholders' meeting.

"There was a lot of bad news in the construction industry this week, such as the bitter cold. It was said that mid-sized construction companies with poor management are suffering one after another.Ultra Engineering & Construction, which is undergoing rehabilitation procedures, has terminated a government-run contract that was already in progress this week following last month.The contract for the new construction of the Agriculture, Food and Rural Quarantine Headquarters building signed with the Public Procurement Service was terminated. Last month, the contract for the relocation of the USFK base was terminated, including the construction of general-class and commander accommodation facilities, the construction of Ulsan Pohang Expressway, the expansion of Naengbu Mountain, and the construction of Seongnam Medical Center.This termination of the contract is because Ultra Construction's liquidity has deteriorated to the extent that it is difficult to carry out the rest of the construction normally.Construction sold some of the industrial land in the Ulsan General Industrial Complex to its parent company.This is the land that was created when the construction company took over the developer's debt on the condition that the developer took over the site and business rights when the sale rate was low and the developer couldn't handle the debt.But the construction, which is not able to afford this debt, sold part of the land to its parent company to pay off the debt.As such, construction is barely holding out thanks to the strong parent company.Sungwoo Construction Co., one of the construction companies of the Pan-Hyundai Department, was decided by the court on the last day to start rehabilitation procedures.Sungwoo Construction, which is owned by Hyundai Cement, participated in the Yangjae-dong Pi City project, but suffered financial difficulties when the project was suspended and eventually went through a year-long workout process of workout.Since then, we have applied for rehabilitation procedures in the past as financial conditions worsened due to new orders and decreased sales.Ultra Construction, Construction, Voice Actor, and Construction are all once successful companies. However, the entire company is facing a crisis as excessive business promotion, especially projects carried out, becomes difficult. All the bad news this week is one of the consequences of the accumulated insolvency.That doesn't mean you're just frustrated. If you shake off the accumulated insolvency with hard work like Ultra Construction and Construction, one day you can dream of revival. Sungwoo Construction Co., Ltd. will also quickly proceed with the rehabilitation process by applying the fast-track method from the court. There will be a lot to lose, but the company can save it if it passes the rehabilitation process well.We look forward to delivering the news to mid-sized builders passing through the tunnel of despair as soon as possible.Lee Seung-hyun: Comprehensive Economic Information Media E-Daily Prohibition of Unauthorized Redistribution"
"This week the construction industry was all eyes on a company flying from Dubai. Dubai Investment Agency has been selected as the preferred bidder for the acquisition of Ssangyong E&C.On the last day, the bankruptcy department of the Seoul Central District Court said it has selected the Dubai Investment Agency as the preferred bidder for the acquisition of Ssangyong E&C, which is under court receivership. In the future, if you sign a memorandum of understanding with the preferred bidder and complete court management through meetings related to the main contract, Ssangyong E&C, which failed to sell five times, will finally face a new owner.The industry showed great interest in the Dubai Investment Agency, which became the preferred bidder for Ssangyong Engineering & Construction. The company is said to have a strong mobilization of funds to the United Arab Emirates following the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. In addition, it is known that there is a large amount of self-order construction invested by funds such as the Dubai Expo. The total assets of the DuaBi Investment Agency are trillion won, with Emirates and Dubai Islamic Bank's Emirates Oil Corporation as its affiliates.There are expected to be many difficulties until the main contract in the future, but the construction industry is applauding the merger and acquisition of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction. This is because the sale of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction must be on track so that the rest of the mid-sized construction companies, which are scheduled to be carried out one after another, can be carried out sequentially.Currently, construction products such as Far East Construction, Namkwang Construction, Dong-A Construction, Ultra Construction, and Hanil Construction are listed one after another in the market.Jeong Su-young, Comprehensive Economic Information Media, E-Daily Prohibition of Unauthorized Redistribution"
"Sentence The aftermath of Ultra Construction, a mid-sized construction company of the Korea Construction Capacity Evaluation Committee, is spreading in the image area. It was excluded from the qualification examination for the construction of a new station outside Icheon, a double-track train in Yeoju, Seongnam.Ultra Engineering & Construction said, ""We had to submit the screening data until yesterday, but we were unable to meet the eligibility requirements due to a drop in credit rating due to the application for the start of the rehabilitation process.""The successful bid screening is a method of determining the successful bidder by comprehensively examining the contract performance ability and bidding price from the companies that bid at the lowest price in the bidding for the government order construction. This review will be conducted before the formal contract.Ultra Engineering & Construction was selected as a candidate for the successful bid screening for the construction of a new station outside Icheon on the Seongnam Yeoju double-track railway with a winning bid of 100 million won on the last day.An official from the Korea Railroad Corporation said, ""The successful bid screening, which takes place before the contract, was decided by comprehensively reviewing the current Ultra construction situation,"" adding, ""We plan to implement existing contracts such as Gimpo Urban Railway.""As such, after Ultra Engineering & Construction applied for court receivership on the last day, concerns are rising over subsequent damage to the workplace in which Ultra Construction is in charge of construction.In the case of the Masan Robot Land construction project, construction was barely started last month after drifting after a groundbreaking ceremony due to the failure of the largest private investment company to submit a loan agreement.Ultra Robot Land, a special purpose corporation established in the year for private sector projects, has Ultra Construction's entire stock of the consortium and other companies participating.The Masan Robot Land project will be automatically suspended for at least a month in the state until Ultra Construction's rehabilitation procedure is decided.According to the original agreement with private operators, Ultra Construction will cancel the designation of private operators and recruit new operators if it is unclear to resume the project, while the rest of the companies participating in the consortium will proceed according to the joint implementation method.The construction of Seongnam City Medical Center, which began construction of a site last year, including the removal of obstacles, is also disrupted. Even if the court approves Ultra Construction's application for court management, Seongnam City Medical Center must obtain the consent of creditors to proceed with the construction.An official from Seongnam City said, ""We will not be able to review whether to resume construction until the court decides."" Seongnam City Medical Center will be built on the site of the old city hall in Taepyeong-dong, Sujeong-gu, with a total area of 10,000 medical departments and a dog clinic bed with the aim of opening in the coming month. A total of 100 million won is spent on the project.Concerns are also rising over additional damage to contractors and suppliers at apartment businesses that Ultra Construction is in charge of construction. Currently, the apartment sites under construction by Ultra Construction include Incheon's Guwol Asiad Athletes' Village tool and Seochang District's Block Gyeonggi Byeolnae New Town and Gwanggyo New Town Block Gyeonggi Band Ultra Chamnuri.An industry source said, ""At the Ultra Construction site, there are many public apartment contractors and there will be no worst-case scenario where the construction will be canceled due to the sale guarantee from Korea Housing Guarantee.""Incheon's Guwol district was ordered by Incheon Metropolitan City Corporation's Seochang district and Byeolnae New Town by the Korea Land and Housing Corporation, respectively. Gwanggyo Gyeonggi Band Ultra Chamnuri is subscribed to the sale guarantee, so even if Ultra Construction's construction becomes difficult to proceed, it can decide on an alternative contractor or contractors can get a refund.Ultra Construction is a mid-sized construction company that was established in the year and focuses on civil engineering construction projects such as road railway bridge tunnel construction. Through the apartment brand Chamnuri, it was sold in Gwanggyo New Town, Gangnam Bogeumjari District, Seoul.The ranking of construction capability evaluation based on the year is above. After the domestic financial crisis, he went into court receivership for the next year, was acquired by a U.S. construction company at the end of the year, and graduated the following year.Park Sung-dae, the reporter Park Sung-dae...Real-time News Money Today, where copyright holders' money is visible, cannot be reproduced or redistributed without permission"
"SENTENCE A sense of crisis is spreading to apartment sites as Ultra Construction of the Korea Construction Capacity Evaluation Commission, which has entered court management in the image area, has been canceled and excluded from the successive bid review.Ultra Engineering & Construction says it is a procedure to give up construction projects that cannot be financed to normalize the company, but anxiety is growing among remaining construction orders and guarantee agencies that have guaranteed payment.According to the Japanese construction industry, Ultra Construction terminated a contract with the Korea Land and Housing Corporation on the construction of a multi-million-won relocation facility project for the U.S. military base in Korea.The construction was won by Ultra Engineering & Construction last month by forming a consortium with Hwain Construction, a company promoting Gyeongnam Enterprise.Ultra Engineering & Construction terminated a construction contract worth a total of 100 million won, including the construction of the Seongnam Medical Center, the Ulsan Pohang Expressway, the National Highway, and the Cold Government Mountain Extension.Last month, it was excluded from the qualification examination even after winning a bid for a new construction of a double-track railway in Yeoju, Seongnam, and Icheon.Currently, the remaining construction includes the expansion of Eungbong Bridge and improvement of performance, the construction of the industrial complex in Saemangeum District, Hoangatoje Mijobuk Port, the Seoul Subway Line, and the Sangju Yeongdeok Expressway in Masan Robot Land, Gyeongnam.In the case of the construction of Masan Robot Land in Gyeongnam, where construction has been suspended, Gyeongnam Province and Changwon City are looking for a construction company to replace Ultra Construction.Kim Min-hyung, head of construction policy research at the Korea Institute for Construction Industry, said, ""Giving up a business that is considered difficult to raise funds or has no business is a common measure for construction companies under court receivership.""An official of the Korea Construction Mutual Aid Association said, ""Other companies can take joint responsibility if they give up construction work, but if Ultra Construction gives up construction work, it will have to pay a lot of money.""Against this backdrop, it is also feared that additional damage to contractors and suppliers of apartment businesses that Ultra Construction is in charge of construction will be caused. The apartment sites currently under construction by Ultra Construction are Incheon's Guwol Asiad Athletes' Village Tool Seochang District Block, Byeolnae New Town, Gyeonggi Province, Gwanggyo New Town Block, Gyeonggi Station, Ultra Chamnuri, etc.An official in the construction industry said, ""Ultra Construction has a lot of public apartment contractors and there is no worst case where the construction is canceled due to the sale guarantee from Korea Housing Guarantee, but there is a possibility that other companies will be recommended to carry out the project.An official from the Korea Housing Guarantee said, ""The court accepted the application for court receivership because the purpose of the rehabilitation is clear, so the construction itself will not be canceled,"" but added, ""We are interested in the possibility of delays in sales.""Park Sung-dae, the reporter Park Sung-dae...Real-time News Money Today, where copyright holders' money is visible, cannot be reproduced or redistributed without permission"
"Kang Hyun-chang gave up the construction of an executive's accommodation at the U.S. military base in Korea, which was being carried out by Ultra Construction. Since applying for court receivership recently, Ultra Construction has been stepping back from the site, which has been underway with the company's normalization. The cancellation amount alone amounts to 100 million won.Ultra Construction announced after the close of the market that the contract for the construction of the colonel and commander's accommodation facilities for the USFK base relocation project with the Korea Land and Housing Corporation has been terminated.This construction was won by Ultra Construction last month by forming a consortium with Gyeongnam Enterprise and Hwain Construction, a promotion company.It was ordered by the Korea Land and Housing Corporation as a project to build the opening of the general-class accommodation colonel and commander's accommodation on a total floor area in Daechu-ri, Paengseong-eup, Pyeongtaek-si, Gyeonggi-do.Ultra Construction has been giving up construction that has been underway since the rehabilitation process began last month.On last month, the construction of Seongnam City Medical Center was abandoned. The cancellation amount is worth 100 million won. As Ultra Construction has a participating stake in the site, it is not certain whether the joint construction company, Gaeseong, will be able to succeed it.This is because if there is no smooth succession agreement on Ultra's stake, the company can also give up the construction contract of the medical center. In this case, it is feared that the construction of the medical center will inevitably be disrupted for a considerable period of time as the process of selecting a construction project has to be retaken.On the same day, Ultra Engineering & Construction also terminated the contract for the Cold Government Mountain Expansion Project on the Expressway No. 1 ordered by the Korea Expressway Corporation. The construction is worth hundreds of millions of won.In addition, the contract for the construction project between Ulsan and Pohang, the highway No. 1, was terminated. The amount is worth hundreds of millions of won.Ultra Construction's remaining construction sites include Eungbong Bridge Expansion and Performance Improvement, Saemangeum Industrial Complex Tool Hoangato Construction, Mijobuk Port Construction, Seoul Subway Line Phase Tool Construction, Masan Robot Land, Gyeongnam, and Sangju Yeongdeok-gan Construction.Ultra Construction filed for court receivership last month. The collapse of the mid-sized construction company, which was healthy above the contraction ranking, is due to excessive guarantees to the owner's private company.According to the Financial Supervisory Service, Ultra Engineering & Construction's debt guarantee balance by debtor as of last month was Golden ENC 100 million won, Ocean View 100 million won, First 100 million won, Eco Cham Nuri 100 million won, and other 100 million won.Among them, Golden ENC is owned by President Kang Hyun-jung and his mother, Park Kyung-ja, and Park's family, respectively.Initially, in the event of a setback in the loans of these companies, President Kang had to shake off his private assets. Kang had already set his stake in Ultra Construction as collateral. If collateral rights were implemented due to problems with loans, it was inevitable to change the largest shareholder, but President Kang applied for court management to open the way to protect management rights.In fact, Ultra Engineering & Construction applied for court management immediately without making any special efforts to extend the maturity or raise funds for repayment to prevent bankruptcy at a time when the loan expires.The following are the major announcements made after the end of the Japanese market.Kospi Market Phoenix Holdings announced that it signed a contract with the Korea Culture Promotion Agency to sell land in Teheran-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and Glastawar Building in Daechi-dong for billions of won to improve its financial structure and secure operating funds.

He is strongly criticizing management, including Ultra Construction CEO Kang Hyun-jung, saying that something unimaginable has happened. How on earth did the management make the surplus company suddenly turn into a court-managed company for a consecutive year?Ultra Construction filed for court receivership with the Seoul Central District Court on the last day. It was because of the cash flow crisis. Ultra Construction was scheduled to expire an electronic bill of 100 million won last year, but when the payment was not possible, it knocked on the court door instead of bankruptcy. Statutory management is a system in which companies and creditors, as well as the national economy, are saved rather than bankruptcy, and the court freezes all bond debts and manages the overall management of selected companies.The Seoul Central District Court, which has been in the black for the consecutive years since Ultra Construction applied for court receivership, accepted Ultra Construction's application for court receivership and approved the commencement of rehabilitation procedures last day. Ultra Construction shares, which had been suspended from trading with court receivership applications, fell to the lower limit for two consecutive days after the suspension was lifted. Usually, if selected as a court-managed company, stock prices are bound to plunge as the possibility of a reduction is high and the company is exposed to the risk of bankruptcy.Ultra Construction is a mid-sized general construction company that ranks in the construction capacity ranking for the year, and earned a net profit of 100 million won in the year. It also made operating profit of 100 million won in the first half of this year. It was not easy for minority shareholders to expect court receivership.However, experts say that Ultra Construction's financial risks have already been conceived for a long time.According to a report released by Nevis Stock, a company specializing in corporate governance consulting, financial risks stemming from CEO Kang Hyun-jung, the largest shareholder, were significant. CEO Kang is the second daughter of the late founder Kang Seok-hwan, who changed his name to Ultra Construction after acquiring Yuwon Construction last year. CEO Kang was one of the businessmen who symbolized the era of the daughter of the chaebol family as Chairman Kang, who had a management rights, handed over to his second daughter. Kang holds a stake in UltraCon, which is the largest shareholder in Ultra Construction.According to Nevis Stock, Ultra Construction has retained earnings of KRW 100 million as of the end of last month and is not in a situation of capital erosion. Moreover, short-term loans fell by about KRW 100 million as of the end of this year compared to the end of the year, and current liabilities also decreased by KRW 100 million. Total debt also fell by 100 million won. At the end of the year, hundreds of millions of won in cash also flowed in. Analysts say that the financial situation seems to have been improving.If CEO Kang Hyun-jung lent 100 million won to a private company without collateral, what would have been the problem? It is a guarantee of payment. First of all, Ultra Construction has provided a payment guarantee to Golden ENC, a golf course-related company, with a limit of 100 million won. Ultra Engineering & Construction also lent the company without collateral worth 100 million won. Golden ENC is a private company owned by CEO Kang Hyun-jung. The capital is only ten thousand won. However, Golden ENC, which was established last year and is pushing to build a golf course in Eumseong, Chungbuk, has a total asset of 100 million won as of the end of the year, but its total debt is more than double that of its assets. be in a state of complete capital erosion The cumulative deficit alone amounted to 100 million won, and there has been no profit in recent years. Every year, a deficit of nearly 100 million won is accumulating due to interest costs. Golden I.N. is also lending CEO Kang KRW 100 million despite the situation.Ultra Construction also gave Ocean View, a golf course operator, a payment guarantee of 100 million won. CEO Kang is believed to be a private company of the owner's family as he owns a stake in the company and the rest is also held by related parties such as his younger brother Min-koo. Ocean View also has a total asset of about 100 million won and a total debt of about 100 million won as of the end of the year. The financial status is not good, with cumulative deficits reaching KRW 100 million. In addition, Ultra Construction has not received about KRW 100 million from Ocean View.Golden E&C and Ocean View applied for court receivership with Ultra Construction on the last day and are currently waiting for the court to decide whether to start rehabilitation procedures.""If Ultra Engineering & Construction had lent money to a sound company, it would have collected funds before court receivership and prevented court receivership,"" a Nevis Stock official said, adding, ""Golden I.N., which lent 100 million won, is a capital-infested company."" Ultra Engineering & Construction management gave payment guarantees and loans to private companies of the owner's family with extremely poor financial conditions through unconventional decision-making.An official from Nevis Stock said, ""Ultra Construction's guarantee of payment to insolvent companies may have directly or indirectly affected the company's creditworthiness,"" pointing to signs of insolvency related to CEO Kang Hyun-jung before Ultra Construction's court receivership.In response, an official from Ultra Construction said that there is nothing to say except for the disclosure.Reporter Song Jin-hyun."

However, due to political instability, the possibility of slow progress of the project cannot be ruled out, so careful observation is needed.E-Trade Securities said, ""The margin is higher than ever because most of the projects ended this year, and the long-term construction plant is also higher than the average overseas margin.

Unlike Sim, a private loan shark and a lawyer who were indicted on charges of siphoning off the shares in question were acquitted by the trial. This is because it happened under the acquiescence of Lee Young-pil, a representative patent attorney of the Lee Young-pil & Mok Patent Law Office, the company's seller and victim at the time.The Seoul High Court's Criminal Affairs Department recently acquitted a private lender, identified only by his surname Cho, of embezzlement in connection with the sale of shares in Zalman Tech by his lawyer, Park.CEO Lee signed a memorandum of understanding to transfer management rights with Manyeo shares of Jalman Tech for 100 million won to Choi and others, the power of mergers and acquisitions of non-capital companies. Choi and others borrowed money from Cho and paid back the billion won Lee borrowed from the bank with a deposit first.

CEO Lee and Choi decided to escrow 100 million won in intermediate payments and 10,000 shares to Park's law firm and exchange shares with each other if the company's sale is passed at the Zalman Tech shareholders' meeting. The stock and money were kept by Park for a while and taken from Cho, the lender of funds.Later in the month of last year, the prosecution investigated Choi's non-capital cases, asking about Lee's whereabouts of the stocks and money, and Lee stated that he had not received money only because of the stocks. In response, the prosecution indicted Cho and Park on charges of embezzlement.The court acknowledged the embezzlement charges of the two. The Seoul High Court, however, ruled that Lee agreed to the idea that his shares would be offered as collateral to private lenders after being reimbursed, saying, ""Lee did not take legal measures such as complaints and knew Park would not be able to keep them."" The Seoul High Court, however, sentenced Cho to months in prison after admitting charges of pretending to pay shares to other companies.CEO Lee handed over the company to Monuel in last year after the company's sale to Choi and others was canceled.Reporter Lim Do-won: Habit of success Do-won Han Kyung-dot-com Unauthorized Reproduction and Redistribution"

"Due to the lack of real profit ahead of the expiration of the event period, the acquisition of new shares of Jalman Tech held by the Bank of Korea has turned into a piece of tissue. This is because the stock price is lower than the exercise, and the profit has disappeared while the expiration of the exercise of the new stock right is just around the corner.The Korea Development Bank announced that the right to acquire 10,000 shares of Iljalman Tech has expired due to the expiration of the exercise period.Zalmantech recently issued bonds worth KRW 100 million to the Korea Development Bank shortly after Monuel, which applied for court receivership, acquired the company.

The main price has also been renewed.The Monuel shock is currently in progress, so the key is how much more stock prices will fall in the future.Monuel took over management rights by participating in the paid-in capital increase of Zalman Tech. Zalman Tech collected operating profit of KRW 100 million last year, up from the previous year. I don't understand that a company with sales exceeding trillion won suddenly went bankrupt. What happened to Monuel? For now, it is estimated that it has caused processing sales. It's about overseas sales among Monuel sales. It is suspected of falsehood in this overseas sales section.Last year, Monuel's sales were about KRW trillion and operating profit was KRW 100 million. Operating cash flow is minus 100 million won. Compared to sales and operating profit, cash flow is abnormal.We can estimate the branches now. There was a problem with the overseas shipping documents or I didn't receive the payment properly.Rather than not being paid for overseas delivery, it is weighing on whether there was a problem with the shipping documents themselves. Analysts say that if the money that will come through the normal route had not been deposited, it would not have reached the last resort of court management.In short, from the beginning, Monuel's overseas sales were full of fraudulent bubbles. The banks' loans are substantial, too It is estimated that the amount of loans Monuel took from commercial banks is about 100 million won. Among them, the amount guaranteed by the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation is estimated to be about 100 million won.With hundreds of billions of won expected to be damaged, the banking sector and Mubo are engaged in a battle to blame each other. Mubo is saying, ""It's the wrong screening. It's the wrong banking sector."" In this situation, the management is missing Monuel's headquarters are in Jeju Island. Only ordinary employees came to work today, but the management did not show up. I can't even get in touch with him.It is also unclear whether CEO Park Hong-seok is overseas or in Korea. Monuel borrowed hundreds of billions of won from the financial sector, but questions are mounting over where this money went and why the cash flow is so poor.Meanwhile, the financial authorities plan to begin full-scale supervision if allegations such as Monuel's accounting fraud occur.Reporter Lee Seung-jong...

"This article was released on Monday in Capital Markets Media Money Today.The possibility of the merger of all-in-person acquisition and acquisition of Soohwa Pretech has become unclear. This is because a key executive of Smart Frontier, which was selected as a preferred bidder, has been accused by the prosecution, sparking controversy over the appropriateness of qualifications.According to the industry, the Smart Frontier Consortium, which was selected as the preferred bidder in the bidding for the sublimation of the pre-tek authorization, has been embroiled in a lawsuit against Digitech Systems, which was delisted from the KOSDAQ market.It is pointed out that it is difficult to understand that a place that went through open competition but failed a similar process due to difficulties in paying funds just a few months ago was selected as the preferred bidder for Sounghwa Pretech.In general, the pre-authorization process is finally selected through a preliminary due diligence process such as a preliminary supervisor for companies that have received a letter of intent to take over under the judgment of the manager and the court.According to the industry, the Smart Frontier Consortium was evaluated to be sufficiently qualified in that it met individual selection criteria in the bidding process despite the failure of Digitech Systems. In the bidding process, it was selected as a preferred bidder while satisfying the minimum standard for proof of balance, an important quantitative evaluation standard.Smart Frontier is known to have submitted a proof of the balance of the total bid amount. Although it did not fully satisfy the total bidding amount, it passed the selection criteria by presenting liquidity that exceeded the minimum standard for bidding for balance certification.The industry is still concerned even though Smart Frontier has met the criteria for selecting preferred negotiators. This is because controversy over appropriateness is heating up in that the candidate for the acquisition failed before the approval and was embroiled in a legal battle over the failure in the same situation.Some point out that there was a lack of meticulous review by the court and the organizer in charge of the review during the open bidding process.The address of Smart Frontier, which recently changed its corporate location, is the same as the factory location of Digitec Systems, where One Solution Partners failed. This is a part that can be guessed by considering the permanence of the corporation between One Solution and Smart Frontier, which failed the approval competition.""If the qualitative evaluation of candidates beyond simple quantitative evaluation was supported in the process of selecting candidates for acquisition, it would have been sufficient to know that One Solution and Smart Frontier were the same corporation,"" said a minority shareholder of Sounghwa Pretech.The court and the organizer only answered that there would be no disruption to the sale of Sublimation Pretech, saying that it was a selection process without defects such as reasons for disqualification in the process. However, during the screening process, he refused to answer whether he recognized that Smart Frontier was the preferred bidder before the approval of Digitec Systems.Smart Frontier Vice Chairman Park Chul-jong said, ""Unlike previous Digitec Systems, most of its affiliates are participating in attracting funds,"" stressing that investors can also understand it as a stable acquisition and investment process as they have promised to participate in management for investment purposes. He then asked, ""Isn't there any other intention to raise controversy after participating in the acquisition of Sublimation Pretech, not when the contract for Digitech Systems was terminated last year?""A Golden Guyan official who filed a prosecution complaint against Vice Chairman Park explained the background of the lawsuit against Vice Chairman Park Jong-chul, saying, ""One Solution, which failed once due to the capital-free drive, was selected as the preferred bidder for another deal.""Reporters Kim Se-yeon: Real-time News Money Today No Reproduction or Redistribution of Copyright Money"
"This article was released on Monday in Capital Markets Media Money Today.Sublimation Pretek, which is seeking a merger and acquisition before approval, is surrounded by a series of unfavorable factors. This is because a person known as the de facto representative of the preferred bidder has been embroiled in a lawsuit over the promotion of a similar approval competition, signaling a red light on the possibility of success.According to Pisoil, the preferred bidder for Seunghwa Pretech, Jang Si-young, CEO of Golden Guyon, who participated as an investor in Digitech Systems last year, sued Park Chul-jong, vice chairman of One Solution Partners, for fraud.One Solution participated in the negotiations as a preferred bidder for Digitec Systems through the One Solution Partners NNT Consortium last year, but the final contract was terminated. One Solution changed its name and location of its headquarters earlier this month as the predecessor of Smart Frontier, which was selected as the preferred bidder for Seunghwa Pretech's approval competition on the last day.According to the director, Park asked CEO Jang Si-young and other investors last year to invest 100 million won out of the 100 million won needed to acquire Digitech Systems in the form of paid-in capital increase and loans. In the process of attracting investment, Vice Chairman Park led investment by Golden Guy and others, saying that 100 million won in procurement funds other than investment can be raised through the issuance of corporate bonds of 100 million won.One Solution failed to raise the balance due to the failure to issue corporate bonds until the payment date of last year. The pre-authorization contract was destroyed, and Digitech Systems eventually abolished its listing as it failed to obtain an audit opinion from an accounting firm.Hong Sung-min, director of Golden Guyon, said, ""Kim Hyung-chul, CEO of One Solution, is only a formal representative, and the actual decision-maker is himself,"" adding, ""He suffered a total of 100 million won in losses as he falsely misled investors without equity capital.Along with the complaint against Vice Chairman Park, Golden Guy also filed a petition with the bankruptcy department of the Seoul Central District Office to ask Digitec Systems investors to recover from the damage.Hong said, ""I understand that One Solution is pursuing another rehabilitation case without capital after changing its name to Smart Frontier,"" adding, ""We will have to take responsibility for it as it has not been able to mobilize funds and has damaged investors in Digitech Systems.""Along with the prosecution's accusation against the executives of DIGITEX Systems' failure, the dispute between One Solution and Golden Guy is also intensifying over the cause of the failure of the authorization competition for DIGITEX Systems.One Solution, which participated in the acquisition as a preferred bidder, claims that Golden Guy, which failed to fulfill the original terms of payment of funds, is the real cause of the failure and delisting.Park Chul-jong, vice chairman of Smart Frontier, explained that the delisting of Digitech Systems lies in Golden Guy, which has failed to pay capital increase funds one after another. He said, ""Golden Guy, who had promised to invest, had difficulty issuing corporate bonds due to the failure to inject funds,"" adding, ""After the failure to issue corporate bonds, the acquisition price was adjusted and the full amount of funds was paid, but the audit opinion of the accounting firm was delayed.""Although One Solution failed to issue corporate bonds under the contract, it is pointed out that Golden Guy, who was responsible for the paid-in capital increase of about 100 million won, failed to pay the funds despite the delay in the payment, seriously affecting investment attraction.Golden Guy and Entipia, which received a total of 100 million won in investment due to the failure of Digitech Systems' approval competition, are refuting the claim as absurd.Hong Sung-min, director of Golden Guy, said, ""The delay was delayed by submitting legitimate reasons to the manager due to difficulties in paying both One Solution and investors,"" adding, ""The contract was terminated because Vice Chairman Park unilaterally changed the terms before the payment date.""In this deal, strategic investors said, ""It is One Solution, not Golden Guy,"" stressing that ""One Solution has never raised the promised acquisition funds and it is absurd to put the responsibility for failing to raise the entire acquisition funds to financial investors Golden Guy.""Golden Guy also presented the bond transfer and pledge-setting agreements signed with One Solution and Entopia, which are suffering from other investment damage, as grounds for attributable reasons.""After the failure, One Solution transferred KRW 100 million of down payment bonds to Golden Guy through an agreement and set up related pledge rights,"" a Golden Guy official pointed out, ""If there is a reason attributable to Golden Guy, it is questionable why they started to transfer bonds and set pledges."" He added, ""The fund was paid by Golden Guyen and Entipia, which all participated in the lawsuit against Digitech Systems, and that it disproved the fact that One Solution, which participated in the lawsuit, did not even inject any funds that could be returned.""Reporters Kim Se-yeon: Real-time News Money Today No Reproduction or Redistribution of Copyright Money"
"This article was released on Monday in Capital Markets Media Money Today.Controversy is intensifying over the possibility of sublimation of KOSDAQ-listed companies, which are undergoing corporate rehabilitation procedures, ahead of the merger and acquisition push before approval. Some raise the possibility of terminating the contract of the preferred bidder, and the possibility of delisting has increased.According to the industry, the Smart Frontier Consortium was selected as the preferred bidder for Soohwa Pretech as a result of bidding for places that participated in the bidding for the approval competition on the last day. If Smart Frontier pays the full amount of acquisition offered at the time of bidding this month, the final acquisition process will be completed.The problem is that Smart Frontier has a history of failing to raise funds in Digitech Systems' approval competition last year.Smart Frontier is the same corporation as One Solution Partners, which participated in Digitec Systems' approval competition at the end of last year. Smart Frontier, which aims to participate in management rights through equity investment in companies, changed its name and headquarters on the last day.Smart Frontier was selected as the preferred bidder by participating in the bidding for Digitech Systems' approval competition by forming a consortium of One Solution Partners Ent. last year. However, the contract was eventually terminated as the acquisition price could not be paid within the payment deadline. Digitech Systems, whose contract was terminated, was eventually delisted following the rejection of the accounting firm's opinion.Sublimation Pretek is similar to Digitec Systems. It presents the possibility of normalizing management through a quick acquisition, and through this, it can be delisted if it does not receive an audit opinion from an accounting firm this month.The industry is concerned that the delisting of Smart Frontier, which failed to be approved due to financing problems, will recur due to the failure of the contract like Digitec Systems, given that it is taking over Sublimation Pretech again.An industry source said, ""Smart Frontier is also considered a professional hunter who participated in the competition for rehabilitation companies,"" adding, ""If Smart Frontier fails to fully pay the acquisition amount offered at the time of bidding, Sublimation Pretech could also be delisted like Digitex Systems.""A minority shareholder of Seunghwa Pretech said, ""It is questionable that a place with a history of failure in the approval process has been selected as the preferred bidder,"" adding, ""If the contract is terminated, only shareholders and creditors who invested in the company are concerned.""Meanwhile, the Seoul Central District Court, which was in charge of selecting the preferred bidder, or Samjeong Accounting Corp., the organizer of the sale, did not seem to have identified the past failures of Smart Frontier.A court official said, ""We cannot answer the question of whether we have found out that the previous corporation of Smart Frontier failed once in the process of selecting the target,"" adding, ""However, it is proceeding without defects in procedures.""It is difficult to rule out the possibility of selecting a negotiating target according to a simple quantitative evaluation without recognizing past failure cases.An official at Samjeong Accounting Corp. said, ""I didn't know if Smart Frontier and One Solution Partners were the same corporation or were involved in Digitec Systems before,"" but predicted that the sale would be unlikely to be disrupted considering that there were no reasons for disqualification.Seunghwa Pretech, a packaging company, recorded more than 100 million won in sales every year, but applied for rehabilitation procedures at the Seoul Central District Court last month amid a liquidity crisis caused by the new project. The Seoul Central District Court, which decided to start the monthly rehabilitation process last year, approved a pre-authorization merger and acquisition to attract outside investors to enhance the possibility of rehabilitation through management normalization.Reporters Kim Se-yeon: Real-time News Money Today No Reproduction or Redistribution of Copyright Money"
"A dog company jumped into the main bid for the sale of Seunghwa Pretech, a KOSDAQ-listed company that is undergoing corporate rehabilitation procedures. Companies showed interest in bridge surface packaging technology owned by listed premium and sublimation pretech.According to the industry, KOSDAQ-listed company Eatron and other places participated in the main bid for the sale of Seunghwa Pretech, which is undergoing corporate rehabilitation procedures held on the last day. In addition to Etron, which runs businesses such as consulting servers and motherboard technology support, unlisted companies such as construction companies also submitted this bidding document.Companies that participated in the bidding reportedly focused on the technology of bridge surface packaging owned by Sounghwa Pretech. Sublimation Pretech, which operates construction businesses such as pavement construction and reinforced concrete construction, has excellent technology in the bridge surface packaging sector such as bridge surface packaging method.In particular, the bridge deck pavement method is recognized as an unrivaled technology in the industry as it has original technology as a joint patent with the Korea Expressway Corporation. Sublimation Pretech's bridge surface pavement method was used on Incheon Bridge, Geoga Bridge, and Jamsil Railway Bridge in Seoul. As it is recognized for its high technology, it is predicted that it will be possible to turn into a surplus if it is out of court management.It is also positive that it has major domestic construction companies as customers. Seunghwa Pretech has POSCO E&amp;C and Hyundai E&amp;C as its main customers.An industry source said, ""We have decided to carry out the rehabilitation process due to the liquidity crisis in the short term,"" adding, ""If we complete the rehabilitation process through the process, we will be able to restore corporate value due to technological competitiveness.""However, the fact that Seunghwa Pretech is set to review the delisting of the Korea Exchange this month is expected to burden companies considering the acquisition. An official of a KOSDAQ-listed company who participated in the main bidding said, ""If the listing is abolished, it is unlikely that the investment will be recovered."" Even if it is selected as a preferred bidder, it may not sign the main contract if it is decided to delist.Sublimation Pretech recorded an annual operating profit margin rate before amortization and achieved sales of more than about 100 million won. However, the company applied for the commencement of rehabilitation procedures at the Seoul Central District Court in last month due to worsening liquidity due to allegations of embezzlement by former CEO Kim Jung-joo, who failed to invest in Marina Port facilities.Last month, the court granted pre-authorization.

"Chinese duty-free business theme stocks have been falling without knowing the end of this year.Some companies have received attention from investors as their stock prices have more than doubled since the announcement of entering China's duty-free business last year. However, stock prices are falling sharply due to expectations for China's entry into the duty-free industry, which has already been reflected in stock prices, and poor performance and unfavorable legal disputes.Experts predict that stock prices of companies entering the Chinese duty-free business will not rise again until tangible results are made in the ongoing Chinese duty-free business. China's duty-free theme stocks have fallen all at once this year.Shares of CL International, which has more than doubled in a month since some companies announced their entry into the Chinese retail and duty-free businesses last year, fell this year. CL International has joined hands with distributor MK International Corp. to establish a Korean living center that distributes Korean goods in the Chinese oil life network, a Chinese state-run company, and to promote duty-free business afterwards.New Pride, whose stock price has more than doubled in a month since signing a duty-free contract with China's Hanam Kwang Transmission New Tower Management Limited in last month, has seen its stock price fall from won to won since the beginning of the year.Cable and wireless communication equipment maker Acupix fell from one won to one. Acupix's stock price jumped more than last month just by announcing that it would hold a general shareholders' meeting to add overseas duty-free businesses to its new business. The duty-free business is slow...The decline in stock prices of these companies due to unfavorable performance lawsuits is due to slower-than-expected tax-free projects This is because poor performance overlaps with unfavorable legal disputes.CL International announced last month that it would attract 100 million won from the Chinese oil life network, a key route to entering China's duty-free business, but it has yet to attract investment. In addition, the contract to supply cosmetics to China's oil network, which was scheduled for this year's month, has been postponed until the end of this year due to the failure of the Chinese government's hygiene permit, making it difficult to enter China.As a result, concerns over management instability seem to have been reflected in stock prices as internal conflicts recently occurred in the process of changing the largest shareholder and appointing outside directors led to lawsuits.Poor performance also played a negative role in stock prices. Poor performance was a risk CL International had even before entering the Chinese duty-free business, but it rose to the surface as expectations for entering China were reflected in the stock price. CL International's sales have continued to fall to KRW 100 million in recent years due to falling sales of goods and games, which were its main business, and recorded operating losses worth KRW 100 million last year.New Pride opened a duty-free shop in Jungwon Boktap in Henan Province last year after signing a duty-free contract with Hanam Kwang Transmission New Tower Management Limited, but suffered an operating loss of $10,000 last year due to various one-off costs. Sales only increased year-on-year to $10,000.Recently, stock prices have fallen due to concerns over financial instability as they were sued last month to demand the return of convertible bonds worth KRW 100 million issued by New Pride. New Pride was also designated as an unfaithful disclosure company because it did not disclose the litigation process.Acupix has not made progress on the project for a while since it announced last year that it would add the duty-free business to the articles of association. In the month of this year, the exclusive operation contract of the Korean Pavilion, an e-commerce site operated by China's state-run central broadcaster, was signed, but the scheduled opening date has not been set. China's duty-free theme stocks are expected to fall...Experts in the securities industry analyzed that the fall in stock prices of these companies was predictable because stock prices were difficult to rebound before the results were released. This is because it is not easy for KOSDAQ companies with insufficient business capabilities to enter the duty-free business and succeed.A head of the stock management division of an asset management company said, ""Many small companies with insufficient expertise jumped in and their stock prices plunged after the popularity of the resource development project,"" adding, ""Many companies jumped in last year, but it was hard to prove their business capabilities.""He then advised investors to invest in consideration of these risks, saying, ""Companies that can carry out businesses from a long-term perspective while sufficiently supporting their performance in their main businesses are likely to grow, but otherwise, new businesses could collapse their main businesses."" ."

"CL International's stock price has been sluggish day after day. This is due to anxiety that the originally expected investment of KRW 100 million in China's oil life network is unclear. For now, the company is in a position that it can complete related investments within the first half of the year.Wang Kang, chairman of China Petroleum Life Network, who was appointed as an in-house director of CL International, planned to end the investment attraction of 100 million won by early this year. The problem is the change in the Chinese government's overseas investment policy stance.According to Japanese and Chinese industry officials, the review by the Investment Review Board has become stricter as more overseas investments have been made in China, where a large number of companies and individuals turn their assets overseas.China's Oil Life Network has already submitted an investment application to the investment management center in Beijing, a financial state, and received a notification from the Investment Review Bureau. However, since then, it has been taking some time to get permission to invest due to strengthening screening standards. China Petroleum Life is in a position to proceed with the investment as soon as it is approved.Although investment is being delayed, CL International is focusing its efforts on Chinese business. First of all, regarding the attraction of Chinese funds, he said, ""There is no problem in securing funds,"" adding, ""We expect to complete the attraction of funds in the first half of the year.""Normalization of management is also progressing smoothly. In the past, from Park Jong-hee to MSPN, foreigners were changed to the largest shareholder. Since then, a paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million has been carried out for MSPN.A company official said, ""We are considering various ways to secure funds so that we can quickly pursue the Chinese business.""Since former CEO Park Jong-hee took office last month, the company has successfully signed an exclusive contract to supply cosmetics, gas, oil and steam recovery devices to the Chinese oil network following the opening of a gallery to establish a duty-free shop. However, specific results of related projects have not yet been made.

"In the KOSPI, China's theme stock, the decline in KOSDAQ, the shipping and shipbuilding construction industries fell a lot, and the stocks that fell the most on the KOSPI and KOSDAQ this year were HOTTECH and CL International.On the KOSPI, stock prices of companies related to shipping and shipbuilding construction, which have been in a recession, fell a lot, and on the KOSDAQ, stock prices of companies that had soared to Chinese-themed stocks were noticeable.Hottech fell from won to won and CL International fell from won to won during the same period, according to Ilwise Fn.Both stocks have something in common that they are theme stocks related to Chinese duty-free shops. HOTTECH's stock price surpassed the won in a month after news broke last year that it would participate in New Pride's paid-in capital increase in self-allocation, which is pursuing a duty-free business in China.CL International also saw its stock price rise more than double over a month after announcing its entry into the Chinese distribution business and duty-free shop business on last month. Since then, stock prices have plunged as the progress of China's duty-free business has been slow and internal conflicts that have recently occurred in the process of changing the largest shareholder and appointing outside directors have spread to lawsuits.Sambu Construction, which is under court receivership, fell from won to won due to unfavorable factors such as potatoes, ranking above the KOSPI's decline rate. Namkwang Construction Co., Ltd. and Kumho Industrial Co., which carried out capital cuts to improve their financial structure, also saw their stock prices fall a lot this year.Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. and Hanjin Shipping Co., Korea's leading shipping companies, ranked top and bottom in the KOSPI's decline rate. Hyundai Merchant Marine fell from 10,000 won to 10,000 won, cutting its stock price in half, and Hanjin Shipping fell from won to won.Shipbuilding equipment manufacturer NK fell respectively.Among affiliates of large companies, the stock price of Hanwha Galleria Time World Samsung Shinsegae International fell a lot. Hanwha Galleria Time World, which beat expectations last year and secured the duty-free shop business rights in downtown Seoul, has been on the decline due to the prospect of sluggish duty-free shop performance.Samsung shares fell below the initial public offering price last month when Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong disposed of the company's shares. Samsung was in the spotlight as an expected stock related to Samsung's governance restructuring, but it changed its position to an underprivileged stock as Vice Chairman Lee sold his stake.Shinsegae International's sluggish performance dragged down its stock price. Shinsegae International has abandoned its ambitious outdoor brand Salomon business, and its cosmetics business, which was expected to be a new growth engine, is also performing below expectations.China's theme stocks include NSV Hanyang Hi-Tao Shinhu, which is above the KOSDAQ's drop rate, and Yonghyun MJB. In the second half of last year, the companies' stock prices soared as they produced themes such as entering the Chinese duty-free shop business and attracting Chinese capital, which were hot themes in the domestic stock market.However, stock prices plunged as the project was sluggish or embroiled in legal disputes. NSV and MJB are currently suspended due to the rejection of audit opinions.Reporter Hwang Jinyoung...

"Unlike last year, when it was spectacular, CL International's stock price is sluggish. Stock prices, which soared to the won last year due to a tie-up with China's oil life network, sank to their original level. The change of mission is overshadowed.An official from CL International said, ""Investors seem to be anxious because the results of attracting investment funds from Japan and China have yet to be visible,"" but added, ""As the Chinese business is proceeding smoothly, we will be able to deliver positive news such as confirmation of attracting investment funds.""Since former CEO Park Jong-hee took office last month, the company has successfully signed an exclusive contract to supply cosmetics, gas, oil and steam recovery devices to the Chinese oil network following the opening of a gallery to establish a duty-free shop. However, specific results of related projects have not yet been made. In particular, the market estimates that Wang Kang, chairman of the Chinese Oil Life Network, is uncertain about his investment in 100 million won. Due to poor performance, it has recorded operating losses of 100 million won and net losses of 100 million won until last quarter.Moreover, CEO Park, who led the Chinese distribution industry last year, stepped down as CEO and sold most of his shares, so there is currently no largest shareholder holding any more shares. A month before the shareholders' meeting, former CEO Park sold his shares, which is currently only a . At the same time, E&Invest also sold all of its shares. Instead, MSP joined as a new shareholder participating in the paid-in capital increase in self-assignment by opening a post-tax exemption store in the Medical Theme Park Mall of Incheon International St. Mary's Hospital.Meanwhile, the company's CEO is Nam Chun-woo, a former in-house director, who was newly elected through an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Monday last year. On the same day, Wang Kang, chairman of the Oil Life Network, was also newly appointed as an in-house director.Investors who look at companies without owners are bound to be anxious. In particular, as CL International's largest shareholder has changed one after another since its listing and its mission has changed one after another, it is time for a clear card to restore investor confidence.

"According to the Financial Supervisory Service's electronic disclosure system, companies that changed their names in the KOSDAQ market for months from this month to this month have increased from a year ago. This is an increase compared to the same period last year. The number of companies that changed their names nearly doubled compared to those that started in the same period of the year.The main purpose of the company's change was mergers and acquisitions and corporate division into new businesses. There was also a purpose to change negative perceptions of companies through name change.Among them, the number of changes in the name due to the reorganization of the business structure was the most common. Bion Shinyang Oracom Interbulls and others changed their names strategically as they entered new businesses. In the case of Romanson, in order to overcome the slump in the existing watch business and spur the fashion jewelry business, it has changed its name to its jewelry brand J.Estina, which has gained recognition through indirect advertisements for the drama ""Descendants of the Sun.""The case of changing the name for the purpose of enhancing the image was shown as . It is also aimed at improving the negative image after events that adversely affect corporate image such as capital erosion and poor performance in the deficit.Steel & Resources, which was in crisis due to capital erosion and recently ended its rehabilitation process, changed its name from resources to Steel & Resources more than a year ago and recently changed it to GMR Materials once again. KD, which recorded an operating loss of 100 million won last year, started a workout with Barun Technology due to a liquidity crisis following the payment guarantee of Bogwang Group affiliates last year Semiconductors sold to the company changed their names to semiconductors.The change in the name due to mergers and acquisitions is a case in which the company for acquisition purposes is representative. Mirae Asset's Hosepack changed its name by merging Cenotech, a research and development company in the ceramic field, and SMG, a mobile game company, Somage, and LIG's Pack, a meat processing company, Jung Da-woon and Gyobosac, respectively.Huons Global Wonik Holdings and others are the cases where mutual changes occur in the process of corporate division that separates profitable businesses into separate corporations. In order to focus on the cosmetics business, which is a key business, Sanseong AlNS has divided its existing corrugated cardboard business division and changed its mission to Leaders Cosmetics.In particular, Huai Brothers, Imagine Asia, Midong & Cinema, etc. changed their names due to the inflow of Chinese capital or entry into the Chinese market.Huai Brothers, a Chinese comprehensive media group, has become the largest shareholder of Sim Entertainment, changing its name to Huai Brothers and expanding its business in China in earnest. Well-made Yedang set its goal to target the Chinese content market by changing its name to Imagine Asia as its largest shareholder changed to Cheongho Comnet. Midong Electronics and Telecommunications changed its name to Midong & Cinema after entering the Chinese movie theater business in earnest.In addition, there were cases in which the name was changed for reasons such as unification of corporate image or mutual overlap.Experts suggest that listed companies, which frequently change their name as well as major shareholders, need to be carefully examined when investing as they are classified as a cautionary item.In fact, CL International has changed its name only once since it suffered ups and downs due to a series of management disputes. It was designated as a management item last month, and the stock price, which once rose to the won due to management disputes and poor performance, recently fell to the won. Oh, my God.

"J&U Global, a manufacturer, soared in stock prices by announcing its entry into China's duty-free business, but its stock price plunged due to uncertainty in its business and the sale of shares by major shareholders. Since then, it has been delisted due to the rejection of audit opinions by the accounting firm.South Korean companies, which heated up the stock market in the second half of last year, returned as a poison to push for new businesses related to China. Among the companies that promoted China's capital attraction and duty-free projects, the reason for delisting occurred. Most of these companies suffered heavy damage from the sharp fall in stock prices.The Korea Exchange said China-related stocks were newly designated as reasons for delisting or management among monthly settlement corporations for the year. In particular, China-related companies have reached among the stocks that caused delisting.Data on stock price fluctuations after the disclosure of Chinese-related stocks All of the places where the Korea Exchange problem arose pushed for new Chinese-related projects, including duty-free cosmetics, and some of them pushed to attract Chinese funds through capital increase. However, most of them failed to push ahead with their projects properly due to poor financial status and failed to attract funds. One of the places where the reason for delisting occurred was rejected by the audit opinion, and the other could not even submit a business report.Most of the people who invested in the favorable issues lost money on soaring stock prices. Shares of China-related stocks fell after an average surge after the announcement. The average stock price decline rate compared to the highest point reaches . In particular, stocks with reasons for delisting had a greater share price fluctuation rate.All of these companies showed similar patterns. Stock prices soared as companies with weak business performance and financial structure announced attraction of Chinese funds or entry into new businesses, but stock prices have since plunged due to certain delays or business failures.In addition, when stock prices rise, insiders, including major shareholders and executives and employees, disposed of their shares. Large-scale sales encouraged the stock price to fall.

"A series of KOSDAQ market listed companies have been struggling to raise funds since the beginning of the year, showing signs related to a surge in disclosure correction that reduces paid-in capital increase or delays schedules. As investor sentiment froze due to unfavorable factors from China, related companies delayed or reduced their paid-in capital increase schedules.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, all KOSDAQ-listed companies that announced correction of the paid-in capital increase this year have announced correction of the change of company. The number of KOSDAQ-listed companies that made correction disclosures related to paid-in capital increase during the same period last year is on the rise, compared to only the number of disclosures about new companies.Among the changes, Shinhu, Farmswell, Bio, Bota, Bio, BIMT, IDS Seotech, etc. postponed the payment date related to the paid-in capital increase of students to two months later. Among them, Shinhu and Botabio tried to raise funds mainly from Chinese companies such as Dandong Heungrun Robot Science and Technology Limited and Cheongdae Group Limited, respectively, but the payment date was delayed.Some companies have reduced the size of paid-in capital increase. Digital Optic, one of the first cases in which a Chinese company was listed indirectly through a domestic listed company, originally sought a paid-in capital increase worth KRW 100 million in common shares, but raised KRW 100 million in funds to acquire securities. The company said, ""In order to quickly raise funds for the company's management, we have revised the group to be eligible for the student allocation, not the group's private equity investment association,"" adding, ""The group has paid for the student allocation."" The Korea Exchange announced on the last day that Digital Optic will be designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to changes in the number of shares issued and the amount issued in the decision to increase capital.Neo-Dian Technology also saw its initial expected paid-in capital increase fall to 100 million won. This is because the scheduled issuance price has been lowered from the existing won to the won as the issuance price of the car has been confirmed.Some companies have decided to withdraw their paid-in capital increase. AT Semicon announced on last year that it would conduct a paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million in student allocation for Popowon. A month later, the company corrected that it had decided to withdraw the issuance of the new shares in the face of a situation in which it was unable to pay within the scheduled deadline due to the internal circumstances of Popo One.

"At the end of the year, the increase in the number of companies with paid-in capital increase allocated to marginal companies means that there are so many companies suffering from financial difficulties.Companies that have made a paid-in capital increase or announced implementation in the quarter reach new companies, and the amount of funding is close to 100 million won. The number of companies with paid-in capital allocation has been increasing since the opening of the last quarter. ""As the end of the year approaches, companies with poor financial structure often seek to improve their financial structure through paid-in capital increase or small mergers and acquisitions to avoid delisting or managing stocks,"" said a financial investment industry official. The industry explains that there is a large amount of self-allocated capital increase, especially for small listed companies that are having difficulty raising funds as the banking sector has recently tightened its screening of corporate loans.In fact, most of the companies that have decided to increase their paid-in capital allocation are management stocks or have difficulty in financial structure management. In the case of IDS, which decided on a paid-in capital increase worth KRW 100 million for the purpose of daily operating funds, there was a delay in repaying the principal and interest of loans worth KRW 100 million. IDS said that overdue payments occurred due to difficulties in cash liquidity and that it will repay them through a paid-in capital increase in student allocation. IDS has been designated as a management item due to the rejection of inappropriate opinions from semi-annual reviews or restrictions on scope and abnormal capital erosion rates. In addition, stocks designated as management items such as Yonghyeon Pacific Biosejin Electronics Oriental Precision AT Semicon have also decided to increase their allotted capital this month.If management stocks companies can solve financial difficulties and shake off insolvency through paid-in capital increase, this is positive for companies as well as stock prices. In the case of Yong-hyun, it was announced in a public announcement that it has decided to increase the allocation of students worth 100 million won for Ilong2 Korea and Hyunjin Material, the largest shareholder. Yong-hyun's stock price rose to the upper limit for a day in a row. However, the problem is that if marginal companies fail to solve their financial difficulties through capital increase or if the paid-in capital increase payment schedule is postponed or canceled, it could lead to a fall in stock prices as well as delisting. In the case of Turbo Tech, it was delisted early this year despite various financial improvement measures such as a paid-in capital increase allocated by the end of last year. Wise Power and Ace Hi-Tech Taechang Paros also increased their capital allocation by paid-in capital, but failed to overcome financial difficulties and were eventually delisted this year.Reporter Roh Hyunseop...

"Investment warnings have been issued for KOSDAQ companies that are feared to be delisted ahead of the deadline for submitting reports in the first half of the year. It is pointed out that if the same problem is added, including listed companies designated as management items above the current capital erosion rate, and companies that are in the process of reviewing their eligibility for listing, a large number of stocks could be delisted. The Korea Exchange said that companies designated as management items due to capital erosion rates or less than 100 million won in equity capital among KOSDAQ-listed companies could be delisted if they fail to resolve the problem even in half-year settlements. The same applies even if the audit opinion is evaluated for rejection of inappropriate restrictions or the semi-annual report is not submitted within the deadline.Among the KOSDAQ-listed companies designated as management items on a daily basis, all of them, including Barunson and ID S Oriental Corporation, are included for reasons beyond the capital erosion rate. Barunson has continued its operating loss in recent years, reaching a capital erosion rate of . The telecommunications equipment manufacturer was designated as a management item last month due to operating losses and abnormal capital erosion rates for consecutive years.

The rate of capital erosion of IDS, a parts manufacturer, is also . Barunson and Oriental Industrial IDS have recently started to improve their financial structure with potatoes and paid-in capital increase, but if they fail to resolve the capital erosion rate in this half-year report, they will be delisted. Jeong Ji-heon, head of the KOSDAQ disclosure system at the exchange, stressed that investment needs to be careful because formal delisting due to certain requirements such as improper audit opinions or capital erosion will be abolished immediately without going through a substantial screening of listing eligibility.Although the reason for delisting was already found in the audit of the monthly settlement corporation at the end of last year, it is pointed out that companies that are undergoing procedures such as filing objections or switching to substantial screening need to be careful about investment. The company is a new company such as Wooseon & Handan Codes Combine, Steel & Resources, L Energy, Sublimation Pretech, and others. Woowon & Handan and Steel & Resources were designated as management items at the end of last year due to the auditor's refusal to comment on financial statements. If the accounting firm's semi-annual review report submitted together with this semi-annual report does not receive appropriate opinions, it will be subject to delisting.Codex Combine, which is currently undergoing a rehabilitation plan, has already reached its capital erosion rate, and it could be delisted if it fails to resolve it in its half-year report. Although some of the reasons for designating sublimation items have been resolved, it is important to check the half-year report as it is more than the capital erosion rate. Pacific Bio, which is subject to a substantial review of eligibility for listing, will decide whether to delist or grant an improvement period after the exchange reviews its improvement plan by the end of this month.Reporter Park Minju...
