12,"As the Ahn Research Institute continues to report reports every day, the relative sense of deprivation of security companies is growing. The Ahn Research Institute is continuing its dreadful upward trend despite the high valuation controversy based on the Ahn Cheol-soo theme. On the other hand, most security companies are having difficulties due to sluggish performance, and the stock prices of some companies are not exceeding the coin stock level. The market closed with a rising 10,000 won. It was the highest during the week and even recorded the highest price of 10,000 won since listing. On the last day, the largest shareholder, Ahn Cheol-soo, dean of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, denies the possibility of running for a new party founding and running for the general election. Reports are continuing the march, showing strength. Investment enthusiasm is heightening with expectations that Director Ahn can go straight to the presidential election. The distributed denial of service attack against the Election Commission, which has recently become a social issue, also stimulated the enthusiasm. Ahn Research Institute's market capitalization recorded KRW trillion at the closing price, rising above the KOSDAQ market capitalization. The value of Ahn's stake, who owns 10,000 shares of the Ahn Research Institute, has also increased to 100 million won. Securities analysts are voicing the opinion that the current stock price of Ahn Research Institute is overshooting due to the presidential election theme, and the analysis is meaningless. The stock price, which is significantly overvalued compared to its corporate value, continues, making it meaningless to present a target price or an investment recommendation. Oullim Information Technology, which was once considered a strong player in the network security market, recorded sales of KRW billion in sales and operating loss of KRW billion in the last quarter. Last year, it recorded an annual operating loss. Oullim Information barely recovered the won's share price on the back of an uptrend in recent trading days. In the industry, the fact that Ahn Research Institute, which has been avoiding top-line growth, is implementing an aggressive order strategy in the network security market to achieve its business goal of this year, KRW 100 million in sales, is also one of the factors contributing to the sluggish performance of other network security companies. . also recorded a quarterly sales of KRW billion and an operating loss of KRW billion. The daily closing price is won. An official said that they are focusing their capabilities on a turnaround in earnings, saying that the number of orders is increasing recently due to a series of major security incidents. one The share price is also maintained at the 10,000 won level. However, EastSoft's software sales, including security, are roughly half of its game business. An official from a security company said that security stocks get a lot of attention when a major security incident occurs, but the overall market situation is still difficult. He said that he expects the market situation to improve next year due to restrictions on the participation of affiliates of large corporations in the public market.

18,"It will take some time to understand the business strategy of SCP, a provider of printed electronic processing lines, which specializes in electronic materials. This is because SCP, a medium-sized company, has taken different steps from general KOSDAQ companies, such as taking over Schram, a leading German chemical company, and selling it. The company said that it would use all of the funds secured by the company to repay short-term borrowings, and that it would change from a coating material specialist to a global electronic material specialist by removing the insolvency caused by a misunderstanding of the market. The transfer will also secure an additional 100 million won. recorded quarterly sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won. The following are Q&A on financial statements with CEO Oh Jeong-hyun and Park Man-ho. From acquisition to sale of German chemical company Schramm Last year, we acquired Schramm, a German special coating material company, and listed it on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2011 and sold it again to Akzo Nobel, a chemical company headquartered in the Netherlands. It was the first attempt by a small and medium-sized company to acquire and sell an overseas company.'s main product was a coating material used for electronic products and automobiles. As all assembly plants moved to China, they also entered China, but their recognition was too low. It was the first Korean company to acquire a German company because of its technological prowess and recognition. After merging with a Chinese subsidiary, it was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. You said there was a misunderstanding of the market. What is it specifically? At that time, our company had 100 million won in assets, of which 100 million won was invested abroad. Shram invested billions of dollars. It was suspected that a mid-level company such as the one could not have invested half of its assets in a Hong Kong company. As a general company, it even received the Board of Audit and Inspection Service. The conclusion was that there were no charges. Why did you sell Shram? There are a number of reasons. First, I wanted to show that the overseas investment sector is real through the sale. Akzo Nobel is a Fortune company. Such a company would not have acquired Schram without a reason. sold Schram at a higher price than the acquisition price. shows that the company has worked hard for business activities.

137,"The Bell|This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. The artificial heart is the most suitable new business for Neo Purple, a small and medium-sized company in Korea, in that it produces great results even if a small investment is made in a short period of time. . Blue Ocean, the representative artificial heart business, is a representative artificial heart business that is in great demand but has limited supply. Among medical devices, which is a representative new growth engine for Neo Purple, the reason for discovering the untapped area of ​​artificial heart lies in the reason that diagnostic devices cost too much and biopharmaceuticals have a low chance of success. Director Lee explained that he set out to find a low-risk business, searched for it, and as a result discovered an artificial heart. Although the basic mechanism of an artificial heart is a relatively old technology that has already appeared in the 1980s, it has not been long since he actually started applying it to the human body. One of the patients who received an artificial heart said that he still broke the record for the longest survival. Currently, only one US company, Soratek, has successfully commercialized an artificial heart. However, the product this company is producing is only one left ventricle assist device that performs the role of the left ventricle of the heart. Heartware has appeared as a competitor, but it is also only being produced and has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Lee said that Cleveland Heart is a latecomer in the artificial heart field, but the Cleveland Clinic, the world's leading cardiologist, USA. He said that it is a company with the best technology as it was established by medical staff, and the strength is that the Cleveland Clinic, a pronoun of the heart, holds the largest stake in Cleveland Heart, so it has secured a stable product supply. He added that the artificial heart of Cleveland Heart has a significant ripple effect in that it overcomes many of the limitations of existing products. And assuming that the price of each artificial heart is $10,000, the size of the artificial heart market is astronomical. The market size is much larger if the standard that replaces the entire heart rather than just the left ventricle is used as a standard. Director Lee generates 10,000 artificial hearts annually, but as it is a customized product, the production capacity of existing companies is insufficient to meet the demand. He said that due to insufficient supply, the current artificial heart market is only formed in the United States, where there are many heart disease patients around the world. Neo Purple, which has invested $10,000 in Cleveland Heart, is considering additional investment. If you invest 10,000 dollars, you can own up to . He explained that it has not been decided yet whether he will directly invest this amount in full.

The merged company, Infomark, is a privately held company that currently produces mobile router compact eggs. However, despite the news of the merger, the market response was lukewarm. On this day, Neo Purple was higher than the previous trading day. A rising circle was recorded. It climbed to the highest during the market, but it only showed a slight upward trend as institutions began to sell. What is the reason behind the merger with Infomark? The company, which has been focusing on the food business, has recently added an entertainment business. However, as sales growth in new businesses has slowed, they are trying to change their main business. Also, last year, we invested KRW 100 million in convertible bonds in Infomark. At that time, it was a simple investment, but the sales increased a lot and I thought it was appropriate to change the business, so I decided to consider the merger. The business relationship between the two companies seems to be declining. Yes. In the past, management focused on existing businesses. However, the new board members tried to diversify their business and thought Infomark was appropriate when they were forming a new business. Infomark's financial situation. Last year's sales and net profit were KRW billion and KRW billion, respectively. Originally, Infomark's main sales were overseas. However, sales have risen since delivery started recently, and sales reached KRW 100 million as of this year. If this trend continues, we expect sales to reach KRW 100 billion this year. Shares remain quiet despite news of the merger. It seems that the information on Infomark was weak and the expectations were not met. In addition, information about the merger with Infomark leaked faster than expected, which seems to have already had an impact. How is the merger going? It has been requested by an accounting firm to evaluate the merger value, such as the asset value and profit value of Infomark, and a report on it has been released and is under review. merger ratio. hasn't come out yet The merger ratio is a matter that requires an agreement between our shareholders and Infomark shareholders. In addition, since Infomark is a privately held company, exact figures for valuation were not available. What effects do you expect from the merger? Our sales are on the decline. Although the business itself is not the president's business, it is insufficient to grow. Orders should increase from places we supply such as Korea Yakult, but we are only digesting the given amount at the moment. Therefore, this merger is meaningful in that it is equipped with a new engine for a company that needed a breakthrough. When do you expect sales to be realized? As the merger is expected to take place within this year at the latest at the earliest, sales will also occur along with it. Sales volume through merger. It is estimated that Infomark's estimated sales of 100 million won this year and the company's sales are estimated at about 100 million won. Last quarter's earnings were negative. Sales decreased significantly, and operating expenses were incurred from new businesses. In the case of sales, we plan to sell one of the factories to reduce the size of the existing food business. NeoPurple's last quarter's sales were 100 million won, Operating loss was 100 million won, and net loss was 100 million won. The reason for the issuance of convertible bonds. A total of KRW 100 million was prepared for each of the new business investments mentioned above. The current share price has halved compared to the end of last year. It was lower at the beginning of last year. The reason why the stock price rose to KRW was because the company entered the entertainment business along with the Korean Wave.

Borrowings have already snowballed due to investments. Interest would have to be paid only when sales increase and profitability improves. Recently, even trade receivables have surged. Even if all receivables and inventories are disposed of, the amount of repayment is insufficient. DS's borrowings increased from 100 million won at the end of the year to 100 million won at the end of last year. At the end of the first half of this year, the borrowings decreased slightly to 100 million won, but considering the recent borrowing of 100 million won from Samsung Display, the current borrowings are not expected to be much different from the end of last year. . The economic downturn made it difficult to improve operating performance and continued investment burden. In fact, the total cash flow from operating activities from 2011 to the first half of this year was 100 million won, but the amount of money spent on investment activities was larger, at 100 million won. They had no choice but to rely on external borrowings for insufficient cash flow. The problem is that the borrowing burden may increase in the future. In addition to borrowings, trade receivables to be paid in the future have also increased rapidly. Trade receivables increased from 100 million won at the end of the year to 100 million won at the end of the first half of this year. On the other hand, trade receivables decreased from 100 million won to 100 million won. Although inventory has increased from 100 million won to 100 million won, it is not enough to pay off trade receivables even if trade receivables and inventory are sold. The loss from the KIKO transaction still remains a burden. DS reconciled with Standard Chartered Bank in January of last year the outstanding amount of KRW 100 million related to KIKO. At that time, 100 million won was converted into long-term borrowings and 100 million won was repaid with DS Asia Holdings shares. However, additional risks are open. The 100 million won repaid is because the difference between the sale price and the value per share of DS Asia Holdings in the coming year must be settled in cash or additional shares have to be transferred. He said that it seems inevitable, and that the difficult situation will inevitably continue for the time being as there is still a burden on Kiko's unpaid balance.

197,청년 취업난 해소를 위해 글로벌 취업과 창업을 확대하고 좋은 일자리를 만들어 정부가 적극 기회를 만들어주고자 한다.박근혜 대통령 당선인의 최근 일성이다.올해 벤처기업 만개 시대 도래가 확실시되는 가운데 새 정부의 벤처를 향한 관심도 그 어느 때보다 뜨겁다. 벤처업계 기대감도 한껏 부풀어 올랐다. 하지만 현실은 장밋빛만은 아니다. 국내에서 사실상 성공한 벤처기업의 기준으로 여겨지는 코스닥코스피 상장 비율은  남짓에 그친다. 개 중 개 정도가 그나마 중소기업으로 올라선다는 의미다.  보고서에서 이제는 벤처기업 수만 늘리는 데 그칠 게 아니라 미국이나 이스라엘처럼 성공률을 높일 수 있도록 패자부활이 가능한 벤처 생태계를 조성할 시점이라고 지적한 점은 의미심장하다.그저 숫자만 만개가 아니라 침체된 우리 경제에 활력을 불어넣어줄 벤처 만개 시대를 만들려면 어떻게 해야 할까.벤처 제 전성기수치 급증했지만 문제는 성공률온라인 영어회화 학습 프로그램 토크리시를 서비스하는 드리머스에듀케이션의 오상준 대표. 그는 여년 전 일을 생각하면 지금도 가슴이 철렁한다.  벤처 붐이 한창이었던 년 오 대표는  아바타를 이용한 온라인 게임을 론칭했다. 그러나 벤처 붐이 꺼지면서 투자자금이 끊겨 울며 겨자 먹기로 사업을 접어야 했다.사업 실패 후유증은 생각보다 컸다. 기술보증기금에서 융자받은 자금 억원을 갚지 못해 신용불량자로 전락했다. 직원 급여를 못 줘 고용노동법 위반으로 법정에도 섰다. 집행유예 년에 한때 가족도 뿔뿔이 흩어져야 했다. 찜질방에서 자고 끼니를 굶는 생활이 이어졌다.민간 투자 유치한 벤처기업 .뿐그렇게 주저앉을 수는 없었다. 당장 생계가 막막해진 그는 한  회사에 입사했다. 년간 근무하며 재기를 위한 자금을 모았다. 년 회사를 그만두고 다시 한번 창업에 도전했다. 퇴직금 만원과 투자 파트너로부터 지원받은 만원을 모아 오디션 잉글리시라는 온라인 영어 게임을 개발했다. 이게 대박이 났다. 억원을 받고 국내외 판권을 한빛소프트에 매각하며 남은 빚을 대부분 청산했다. 이후 년 개발한 토크리시는 현재 삼성 를 비롯한 대기업과 하이스트 정철어학원 등에서 영어학습 프로그램으로 채택됐고 회사는 지난해 연 매출 억원 회원 만명의 탄탄한 기업으로 성장했다.벤처기업 만개 시대가 눈앞에 다가왔다. 벤처확인 공시시스템 벤처인에 따르면 지난해 말 기준 벤처 인증을 받은 벤처기업은 만개. 최근 년 동안 연평균 개가량 벤처기업이 증가했던 걸 감안하면 연내 벤처 만개 시대가 도래할 전망이다.벤처기업이 늘면서 년대 말년대 초 벤처 붐 이후 년 만에 또다시 제 벤처 붐 기대가 커졌다.년대 초반 변대규 이민화 조현정 장흥순 등 벤처 세대들이 창업한 초기 벤처기업이 하나둘 나타났다. 세계  시장이 호황을 맞고 김대중 정부가 적극적인 벤처 육성에 나서면서 년대 말부터 년대 초까지 벤처업계는 초활황기를 구가했다.하지만 급하게 뜨거워진 벤처 열기는 금세 과열 양상으로 치달았다. 액면가 원짜리 주식이 수십만원에 거래되는 일이 비일비재하자 투자자들은 대박 꿈에 빠졌다. 회사 이름에 인터넷 테크만 붙어도 투자금이 우후죽순 몰려들었다. 그러나 년 초 미국 닷컴 버블이 붕괴되면서 한국 벤처기업도 줄줄이 역사 속으로 사라졌다.벤처기업 수는 년 만개에서 년 개로 년 만에  급감했다. 그렇게 끝난 것처럼 보였던 절대 다시 오지 않을 것으로 여겨졌던 벤처 붐이 최근 또다시 나타나고 있는 셈이다.정부도 벤처기업 육성에 나섰다. 중소기업청과 벤처기업협회는 올해 선도벤처연계 창업 지원금을 대폭 늘렸다. 지난해 억원에서 올해 억원으로 증가했다. 창업 년 내 초기창업자와 예비창업자가 최대 만원까지 사업비를 지원받을 수 있다. 한국콘텐츠진흥원은 멘토링 프로그램 자금을 지원하며  벤처기업의 해외 진출을 돕는다.인수위도 벤처기업 지원에 팔을 걷어 붙였다. 벤처기업을 창업했다가 실패한 청년들이 정부 기업이 조성한 펀드를 통해 재창업 보조금을 받는 방안을 추진 중이다.벤처기업 수가 급증하고 있지만 진정한 벤처기업 전성시대로 보긴 이르다는 분석도 많다. 순수한 의미의 벤처기업은 그리 많지 않기 때문이다.한국개발연구원에 따르면 벤처캐피털이나 엔젤투자자로부터 기술력 성장 가능성을 인정받아 투자를 유치한 순수한 의미의 벤처투자기업은 전체의 .에 불과하다.대신 기술보증기금이나 중소기업진흥공단이 기술력을 인정한 중소기업을 뜻하는 기술평가보증대출기업이 를 넘어섰다. 김기완  연구위원은 정부가 정책적으로 지원해 벤처 인증을 받은 기업이 대다수라 진정한 의미의 벤처 붐으로 보긴 이르다고 지적했다.벤처기업 수는 급증했지만 벤처기업 성공률은 오히려 떨어지는 분위기다. 반짝 등장했다 소리 소문 없이 사라지는 기업이 수두룩한가 하면 코스닥에 상장한 벤처기업 수는 년 개에서 년 개로 오히려 줄었다.벤처기업에 안주할 뿐 더 이상 성장하지 않으려는 경향도 두드러졌다. 창업 이후 년 이상 벤처기업에 머무르는 기업만 .에 달한다. 매출 억원을 돌파하는 데 걸리는 평균 기간만 년을 넘는다는 통계도 있다. 중견기업 대기업으로 성장하면 정부 지원이 급감하는 만큼 벤처기업 지위를 계속 유지하려는 일종의 피터팬 증후군 탓이다.년 매출 조원을 돌파한 벤처기업은 과 절연코일 전문업체 삼동뿐이다. 초고압 변압기 코일 분야 세계 위 기업인 삼동은 매출 조억원을 기록해 사상 최초로 조원을 넘겼다. 창업 이후 년간 소재 분야 한 우물을 파 년 매출 억원을 돌파했고 년 만에 배 성장하는 저력을 보였다. 반면 년 매출 조원을 넘었던 디스플레이기업 디에스와 태산엘시디는 더 이상 성장세를 이어가지 못했다.벤처기업 수가 만개에 육박했지만 내실이 없다는 지적이 많다. 사진은 지난 월 일  주최로 열린 글로벌 취업창업대전 현장.벤처 생태계 열악해 성공률 낮아벤처기업 성공률이 떨어지는 이유에 대해 전문가들은 선진국에 비해 우리나라 벤처 생태계가 턱없이 열악하기 때문이라고 지적한다. 미국 초기 벤처기업들은 벤처캐피털이나 엔젤투자를 통해 대부분 자금을 조달한다. 년 당시 미국 창업 기업이 벤처캐피털을 통해 조달한 금액은 조원이었고 엔젤투자로도 조원을 끌어왔다.반면 우리나라는 같은 해 벤처캐피털 투자금이 조원 정도에 그쳤고 엔젤투자는 억원에 불과했다. 창업 초기 대부분 벤처기업이 민간 투자가 아닌 정부 정책자금을 융자받는 데 그쳤다는 얘기다.미국에선 창업 실패에 대한 두려움도 덜하다. 창업 후 파산했을 때 미국은 억만원 이하 거주주택에 대해 압류가 면제되지만 우리나라는 임차보증금 만원과 생계비 만원까지만 보호된다. 또 국내에선 한번 실패하면 영원한 실패라는 꼬리표가 따라붙는다. 실패를 감수하고 과감히 창업하려는 이들이 줄어들 수밖에 없는 구조다.김범석 쿠팡 대표는 우리나라에서는 벤처 창업에 실패하면 개개인이 경제적 부담을 모두 떠안아야 하지만 미국은 실패한 경험을 성공 못지않은 경력으로 인정해준다. 우리나라 개발 전공자들은 항상 취업 걱정에 시달리는데 개발만 열심히 해도 충분히 인정받고 보상받는 환경을 만들어줘야 한다고 지적한다.벤처기업 스스로 변화해야 한다는 지적도 나온다. 대기업 위주 산업구조 속에서 벤처기업이 대기업 동반자가 아닌 하도급 업체로 전락하고 있다는 우려다. 벤처기업 매출 대부분이 대기업에 의존돼 있고 해외 진출도 부진한 실정이다. 중소기업청에 따르면 벤처기업들의 평균 매출액 중 기업 간 거래 비중이  기업 대 정부 비중은 로 대다수를 차지했다. 이에 비해 해외 거래 비중은 . 개인 거래 비중은 .에 그쳤다.  연령을 봐도 대 비중이 에도 못 미쳐 청년층의 벤처기업 창업이 장년층보다 오히려 적다. 벤처도전정신 공식이 사라진 셈이다.대기업 의존 해외 진출도 부진벤처기업이 전문기업으로 도약하기 위해 인수합병이 활성화돼야 한다는 목소리도 높다. 미국 인텔 마이크로소프트도 처음에는 작은 벤처기업이었지만 각종 를 통해 글로벌 기업으로 성장했다. 미국은 활발한 를 통해 성공적으로 투자금을 회수하는 데 비해 우리나라는 자금 회수 유형 중  비중이 .에 그친다. 대부분 기업공개에만 의존하는 구조다.대기업이 정당한 대가를 지불해 하지 않고 특허전쟁으로 기술을 빼앗는 것도 국내 벤처기업들이 투자금을 회수하기 힘든 이유 중 하나다. 세미 누드에 가터벨트를파멜라 앤더슨 파격 뒤태 헉  안팔리자 기아차 작심하고 현대 에쿠스를 보아 아슬아슬한 핫팬츠 보아 절정 미모 과시 서수진 청순과 섹시의 이중주사랑스러운걸 어떡해
198,"Major domestic companies that achieved more than KRW trillion in sales are looking for new food. According to the Japanese industry, specialized companies such as Hansol Technics and Taesan LCD DS are looking for new avenues with materials and finished lighting products. The three companies are major customers Samsung Electronics' business was hit as it moved module assembly to China. Although all three companies surpassed the trillion won in sales last year, they recorded less than the trillion won in sales last year. Profitability also deteriorated remarkably. Taesan LCD recorded KRW trillion in sales and KRW billion in operating profit last year, but it turned into a loss on KRW billion in sales last year. Hansol Technics also recorded KRW trillion in sales and KRW billion in operating profit last year, but it turned into a loss last year with KRW billion in sales. DS turned to a loss in sales of trillions of won last year, compared to the previous year, and the deficit widened in sales of billions of dollars last year. All three companies are in a situation where they have to push for new businesses with the stake in their survival. It plans to be reborn as a manufacturing and sales company. The goal is to increase sales of more than KRW 100 million with finished products only in the second half of this year. Since then, the offline market is also being considered. Last month, it sold a limited number of inches through an online shopping mall auction. Hansol Technics entered the sapphire ingot and wafer business in earnest from last year. Last month, it raised KRW 100 million by issuing corporate bonds to expand new businesses such as sapphire ingots and wafers. Hansol Technics plans to increase the proportion of materials business, which was only a small percentage of total sales last year, by this year. The business made about 100 million won in sales, and it is expected to reach 100 million won this year. DS turned its attention to optical bonding lighting and is making little by little this year. It was designated as a lighting company by Philips and recently signed a lighting supply contract with Osan City. In addition, we are focusing on the development of phosphor, a material. Optical bonding, a technology that improves visibility caused by an air gap between display tempered glass and an air gap, was first introduced to the Japanese market. Optical bonding technology was applied to inch electronic signage installed in Japanese subway stations, and it is expected to be able to supply to the domestic market from the quarter of this year. An industry insider said that major domestic companies have already stopped production in Korea He said, ""Each company goes into China with Samsung according to its strategy and maintains production, but it seems that they are concentrating on new businesses to create new food,"" he said.

199,"DS Global CEO Lee Hun-jae is holding a car black box capra at the headquarters in Dodang-dong, Bucheon. Reporter Eun Jeong-jin, CEO of DS Global, Lee Hun-jae. Using technology to supply police agencies such as Brazil, women's police cars lined up in front of St. Petersburg City Hall. State police officers are installing black boxes on patrol cars all at once. When the issue of police who paid money and turned a blind eye to illegal U-turns became controversial, the provincial police department installed a black box on all vehicles to prevent fraud. This appearance was introduced throughout Russia through the state broadcaster News. It is an anecdote that made DS Global, a small and medium-sized black box manufacturing company, become famous abroad. The company supplied a black box carpa to the St. Petersburg Police Department in its only year of founding. It is a good thing that we pioneered the overseas market for the first time, but as the product was introduced through the news of the state-run broadcasting, it had the effect of drawing additional orders from all over Russia. From the end of last month, it started supplying black box units to the Brazilian Police Department in São Paulo. Next month, a 10,000-scale export contract with the Shizuoka Truck Association of Japan is also ahead. DS Global expects to achieve sales of KRW 100 million this year thanks to its recent export performance. A double growth compared to last year's sales. This is because the leading companies have been targeting overseas markets from an early age, avoiding the oligopolistic domestic market. President Lee Hun-jae said that he felt limited in price competition in the domestic market due to the offensive of low-priced Chinese products, and explained that he focused on breaking through the market for business-to-government transactions and inter-company transactions such as taxi associations of the National Police Agency in each country based on his confidence in technology. President Lee, who was in charge of overseas marketing at a medical device company, boldly resigned last year and established DS Global. The president, who started his business in an officetel with a deposit of 10,000 won a month, chose his site as the main seller. He opened up his market by posting products on the site and communicating directly with overseas buyers. President Lee introduced that, thanks to the use of the site, marketing costs were almost zero and he was able to understand the unit price flow and item technology of competitors. For other products, the black box does not work properly when a bad sector occurs in the memory card that stores the image, but DS Global products find the remaining normal sector even if a bad sector appears and save the image. The black box market is expected to grow rapidly. President Lee emphasized that the company will maintain its competitive edge in overseas markets by developing an intelligent black box platform that combines Wi-Fi and 3G mobile communication.

201,"POSCO M-Tech has set out its first shovel to build production facilities for Indonesia's aluminum deoxidizer alloy business. POSCO M-Tech, a comprehensive materials company, announced that it had a groundbreaking ceremony for a plant jointly established with DS Liquid in Jakarta and Cilegon, Indonesia. The joint factory is to produce aluminum deoxidizer and alloy materials in Indonesia and supply it to the POSCO joint steelworks and domestic and foreign aluminum alloy companies, the company explained. It was conducted with a schedule such as an on-site inspection, and several people including Yong-cheol Yoon, CEO of POSCO M-Tech, attended. was established and promoted. POSCO M-Tech established a corporation under the name of POSCO M-Tech Indonesia in January last year, but DS Liquid participated in the capital increase and the joint venture was established. An official of the company said that the establishment of the joint plant will allow the production of 10,000 aluminum deoxidizer and 10,000 tons of aluminum alloy annually within the next year, and is planning normal operation from January. It is planning to enter the Southeast Asian market, which is expected to be in full swing. The company expects that POSCO M-Tech will start full-scale production from next year and generate new sales. POSCO M-Tech CEO Yoon Yong-cheol said that both companies are expecting cost savings through realizing economies of scale through this joint venture. He said it would be of great help to business activities in the region.

202,"The dragon light source industry, which once approached trillions of dollars, is disappearing in Korea. According to the related industry in Japan, Taesan LCD has stopped domestic production. Although Hansol Technics is still producing domestically, it has decided not to invest in this business any more and is concentrating on new businesses. DS is conducting business by receiving orders through a domestic corporation, but it is produced in a factory in China in the form of consignment production. Looking at last year's sales, Taesan LCD recorded trillions of won, DS recorded trillions of won, and Hansol Technics recorded trillions of won. The combined sales of the three companies are over trillions of dollars. Most of these companies' sales come from , and they dominate the domestic market. Considering this, the size of the domestic market is close to trillions of won. However, last year, as the industry fell into recession, sales of all three companies decreased due to decreased production. Taesan LCD is worth 100 million won. DS in billions. Hansol Technics in billions of dollars. decreased As a result, the overall market size also decreased to the trillion won level. The reason why Taesan LCD DS Hansol Technics stopped production in Korea is because Samsung Electronics, its main customer, is moving module assembly to China. Samsung Electronics has shifted most of its module production to China for reasons such as expanding cost competitiveness and targeting the Chinese domestic market. Taesan LCD and DS Hansol Technics have stopped production in Korea or reduced their production volume significantly, reducing the number of employees. In the case of Taesan LCD, the number of employees as of the end of last year decreased from the number of employees as of last year. DS decreased from the number of persons as of the end of last year to the number of persons as of the end of last year, and Hansol Technics decreased from the number of persons to the number of persons during the same period. Taesan LCD and DS plan to continue production through their factories in China. Instead, the strategy is to focus on increasing profitability through new businesses in Korea. Hansol Technics practically stopped the operation of its Slovakia plant, which it entered first, and plans to focus its investment on new businesses such as sapphire ingots and wafers, which are materials. It is a natural procedure to move to the company, saying that it will not be as good as when the business was in full swing, but the sales volume from China will not drop sharply compared to last year. In Korea, the company is improving profitability through new businesses such as phosphors and power semiconductors, and a turnaround is possible from this year, he said. In particular, he said that the sapphire ingot and wafer business is expected to gradually improve toward the second half of the year.

203,디에스 디스플레이 전문기업올해 흑자전환 자신어린 자녀가 있어도 일이 전혀 부담이 되지 않습니다. 회사가 직접 운영하는 어린이집에서 일하는 동안 아이를 가족처럼 돌봐주기 때문이죠.어린 자녀를 둔 디에스 직원들은 회사에서 일할 때 자녀 걱정은 덜어둘 수 있다. 회사에서 직접 운영하는 어린이집에서 일하는 시간 동안 아이를 돌봐주기 때문이다. 비용은 회사의 지원을 받아 일반적인 어린이집의  정도 밖에 들지 않는다.특히 어린이집에서 일하는 원장을 비롯한 선생님 모두가 디에스 정직원이다. 그만큼 아이들을 다른 어린이집보다 가족같은 마음으로 돌보고 있다.아빠나 엄마가 출근할 때 손을 잡고 같이 어린이집으로 등원하고 부모가 퇴근할 때 같이 어린이집을 나서 집으로 올 수 있다는 점도 빼놓을 수 없는 장점이다. 아빠나 엄마가 야근을 할 때도 쉬는 날 특근을 할 때도 어린이집에서 아이를 시간에 상관없이 돌봐준다.경기도 화성시에 있는 디에스 본사. 오른쪽에 푸른색 건물이 직접 운영하는 어린이집 건물이다.모든 임직원이 정직원임원과 도시락 간담회까지 디에스는 모든 임직원을 정규직으로 채용하고 있다.제조업을 영위하는 많은 중소중견기업이 생산직에 근무하는 직원들을 계약직으로 채용하거나 외부 용역업체에 맡기는 것에 견줘보면 디에스의 기업 철학을 엿볼 수 있다. 자체적으로 운영하는 어린이집 관계자뿐 아니라 보안 미화 업무를 담당하는 직원들도 전부 정규직으로 채용하고 있다.이 같은 기업 운영 방침으로 인해 디에스는 지난 년 여성가족부로부터 가족친화인증기업에 고용노동부로부터 고용창출 대 기업 등에 선정되기도 했다.사장을 비롯한 회사 임원과 사원이 함께 하는 도시락 간담회는 디에스의 빼놓을 수 없는 직장 문화다.디에스는 한 달에 한 번 사장 등 임원이 사원을 격려하고 현업의 문제점이나 애로사항 등에 대한 의견을 듣기 위해 도시락 간담회를 개최한다. 도시락 간담회에선 임원과 사원이 직접 의사소통하며 공감대를 나눌 수 있다. 사원에겐 회사 생활에 대한 조언을 듣고 그동안 궁금하게 생각했던 점에 대해서 물어볼 수 있는 좋은 기회인 셈이다.디에스는 이 외에도 임직원들이 회사를 집처럼 느끼게 하기 위한 여러 조치를 마련해두고 있다.디에스는 집과 회사의 거리가 멀어 출퇴근이 용이하지 않은 직원을 위해 무료로 이용할 수 있는 기숙사를 운영하고 있다. 기숙사에는 임직원의 건강을 위해 전문 간호 인력을 채용하고 의료 시설을 두고 있다.기숙사를 이용하지 않는 직원들을 위해선 통근버스를 비교적 먼 지역까지 운영한다. 경기도 화성시 동탄면에 있는 디에스는 오산 동탄은 물론 수원 용인 천안까지 통근버스를 운영한다.또 임직원의 결혼기념일이나 배우자의 생일 등 이벤트가 있을 때는 집으로 꽃바구니와 샴페인을 보낸다. 직급에 따라 본인 뿐 아니라 가족까지 종합건강검진을 받을 수 있는 기회를 제공한다. 임직원 자가발전을 위해 사이버 연수원을 운영하며 근로기준법 인사노무관리 등 직무 교육이나 어학교육 독서통신교육 등을 무료로 받을 수 있다.가족과 함께 하는 행사도 적지 않다. 좋은 일터 만들기 행사 디에스 한마음 운동회 가족과 함께 하는 봉사활동 난치병 가족을 돕기 위한 헌혈행사 등을 정기적으로 실시하고 있다.시련은 끝났다올해 흑자전환 자신 디스플레이 전문기업 디에스는 지난 년과 년 시련을 겪었다. 액정표시장치 패널 가격이 꾸준히 하력하며 시장 상황이 전반적으로 좋지 않았던 탓에 년 연속 적자를 기록했다.지난 년 조억원의 매출을 올리며 사상 최대 기록을 달성했지만 억원의 영업손실을 기록하며 적자전환했다. 지난해에는 매출액 억원에 영업손실 억원을 기록했다. 적자폭이 배 이상 늘었다.오인환 디에스 사장디에스는 올해 절치부심한 끝에 중국 법인의 실적 향상 국내에선 신규 사업 추진 등을 통해 흑자전환 달성을 자신하고 있다.주 고객사의  물량이 중국으로 대부분 넘어가고 있는 만큼 디에스의 중국 법인은 올해 지난해보다  이상 성장할 것으로 기대하고 있다. 디에스 중국 법인은 지난해 억원 이상의 매출액에 영업이익률 약 .를 기록한 것으로 추정된다. 올해는 원자재 내재화 등을 통해 영업이익률 역시  수준까지 끌어올린다는 계획이다.국내에선 옵티컬 본딩 발광다이오드 조명 전력반도체 등 신규 사업을 통해 수익성 개선에 나선다. 주력 사업인  모듈과 후면조광장치가 중국으로 넘어가면서 매출 규모는 줄겠지만 수익성을 높이고 미래 먹거리를 찾는 데 힘쓰겠다는 방침이다. 일부 신규사업에선 올 상반기부터 성과가 나올 것으로 기대하고 있다.최근 몇 년간 디에스를 괴롭혀왔던 키코 문제도 해결한 만큼 발걸음이 가벼운 편이다.오인환 디에스 사장은 올해는 중국 법인의 실적 향상과 국내 법인의 흑자 전환을 통해 디에스가 새로 도약하는 한 해가 될 것이라고 말했다. 상장사 영업실적 중소기업|중견기업|디에스|가족| 네일아트 하루 만원 벌어도 눈물 왜 최수종 딸 공개 설리랑 똑같아 이대로만 노페 비싼이유 할인금지 어기면 벌금이 김형태 대질조사서 결국혐의 일부 인정 압구정 가슴녀 본사람 아무도 없는 이유김도윤기자 저작권자  돈이 보이는 리얼타임 뉴스 머니투데이 무단전재 및 재배포 금지

215,"Failed to sell Mycogent Troschnell Life Sciences Direct hit The stock price plunged as the management rights sale contracts of listed companies were terminated one after another. Investors are boiling their stomachs. Experts are emphasizing that it is necessary to know the actual circumstances of the merger and acquisition to prevent damage from hasty investment. According to the electronic disclosure system of the Financial Supervisory Service on the day, Mysco announced on the last day that its management rights and the largest shareholder's share transfer contract worth KRW 100 million had been terminated. This is because the balance due date, which was originally due to be paid by work, was postponed twice, but even the work was not deposited. On the same day, Running announced that it would cease negotiations on the sale of its management rights. Running signed a contract to transfer management rights last year, but the contract was canceled after several delays in payment of the balance. The buyer, who signed a contract to transfer management rights last month, has delayed the balance payment six times so far. Last month, Schnell Life Sciences and Sublime Luxury Construction could not pay the balance and intermediate payments, so the management transfer contract was broken. Considering this, it is calculated that many of the management rights contracts are canceled or creaky. Experts in the merger and acquisition industry look for the cause in the stock price. Usually, when is announced, the stock price tends to rise in anticipation of the new owner. A few dozen percent is the basics, and if celebrities or popular themes are included, it has risen several times. However, these days, it tends to rise sharply and then return to its original position. As the stock price moves lower than what the acquirer expected, the contract begins to falter. Usually, people who buy businesses on the market borrow a significant portion of their money. Some borrow bonds with the previous largest shareholder's stake as collateral without paying the balance. Under the assumption that the stock price will rise, the bond lender and the underwriter enter into a principal-secured loan contract. If the stock price does not go up, it is a structure that will cause a setback in financing. In the case of Mysco, the stock price, which had risen to one won during the day, closed down to one won. Investment industry experts said that the overall market slump and the supply and demand structure of so-called players are getting harder. He advised that it is best to avoid companies that do not pay interim payments or balances on time because of the risk of When the contract was announced, he added that it was important to carefully examine where the acquirer was.

Mysco expects to add KRW billion in sales and KRW billion in operating profit next year only in the new business sector. Company officials are already interested in a solution that recognizes people or objects and displays relevant information in the database on the screen. He explained that it would be possible to turn to a profit by adding new business results next year.. What kind of business is it specifically? It is a technology that recognizes people or objects through cameras such as mobile phones, mobile devices, etc. It can be applied in various fields. For example, if a person is reflected in security, the person is notified through database search, and in the industrial field, the material or equipment is automatically recognized and related information is displayed on the screen. Can a forging company, Mysco, start a business suddenly? One company will provide manpower and technology, and we will provide funds and external sales support. MYSCO will invest a total of about KRW 100 million. As a small research company, it was difficult to receive new investment or win large-scale orders, so we decided to proceed with Mysco. We have been preparing since the end of the month, and officially we have been running the business together since the end of the month. We plan to hold an event for the press and institutional clients soon.. The forging industry has been making losses for consecutive quarters in a row. What is Mysco looking forward to through this new business? In the meantime, the business environment continued to deteriorate due to the overall sluggishness of the shipbuilding and petrochemical plant industries, which are downstream businesses. With this project, it is possible to not only make up for the sluggishness of the existing forged products business, but also to present a new image and vision of the company through advanced business. It has a competitive advantage in the field of image analysis solutions, and the application fields of this technology are diverse and there is a lot of demand.

237,"High growth potential, such as Susimtech, to prepare for economic recovery Therefore, some argue that it is necessary to pay attention to companies that are laying the groundwork for future growth by increasing facility investment or entering new businesses. The reason for increasing the investment is that the outlook for the industry is positive and it is highly likely that the management's confidence in the business is reflected. However, it is pointed out that there are listed companies that make unreasonable investments due to vague expectations for new businesses, so it is necessary to carefully examine the details of the investment.

It is analyzed that preemptive expansion of facility investment will guarantee considerable growth potential when the uncertainty that has been putting pressure on the global economy is improved and the money released by the financial easing policy turns to investment in risky assets. Hong Seung-pyo, a researcher at Samsung Securities, explained that among domestic companies, there are places where internal reserves have reached an all-time high due to continuous profit growth and reduced investment, and the desire to resume facility investment is growing.

Companies entering new businesses such as chemicals are also paying attention. Chemicals are an example. Last month, Chemical decided to spend 100 million won to build an eco-friendly, high-performance plastic material production facility in the Ulsan plant. Kim Na-yeon, a researcher at Daewoo Securities, analyzed that the green chemical division's profitability would improve with the expansion of the eco-friendly material and biodiesel business.

244,"Do not be deceived by high returns after the announcement due to a lot of share price declines after the announcement. Do not be deceived by high returns. Recently, domestic listed companies suffering from sluggish performance due to deteriorating internal and external economic conditions are calling for attention as they are issuing rights offerings one after another. It is pointed out that capital increase can be a means to secure investment resources and improve financial structure from a company's point of view, but it may dilute shareholder value, so it is necessary to carefully consider this before investing. For example, among the companies that announced their plans for a capital increase, the company that decided to issue a rights issue through public offering was the company. This is more than the companies that issued a rights issue last month. The problem is that most of the companies that decided to issue a rights issue are suffering from sluggish performance. Hyundai Merchant Marine announced that it would decide to issue a rights issue worth 10,000 shares of common stock per day. If a forfeiture stock is issued after shareholder allocation, a public offering will be held for general investors. Hyundai Merchant Marine recorded a cumulative operating loss of KRW 100 million in the first half of the year. Lotte Insurance, which posted an operating loss of KRW 100 million in the previous quarter, also announced that it would decide to issue a rights issue in the size of 10,000 shares of common stock through a general public offering method after the allocation of shareholders. Mysco announced that it would issue a capital increase of 100 million won through a general public offering method, but Mysco's accumulated operating loss in the first half of this year was 100 million won, a larger loss compared to the same period last year. In addition, Solgo Biomedical and Enex, which have suffered sharp declines in their earnings or turned into losses, are also in the process of capital increase. An analyst at a securities company said that companies with poor performance were paid in order to avoid the monitoring network of the financial authorities and improve their financial structure ahead of year-end settlement. He pointed out that the number of cases of capital increase is increasing, and although a rights offering is positive in that it can improve the financial structure, it also dilutes the value of stocks, so investors should be careful. many. This is because, in general, when companies issue a rights issue, a discount rate is applied to the base price to determine the issuance price of new shares. In this case, the size of the financing may be reduced due to insufficient subscription volume, and there is a risk that the value of existing stocks will be further diluted as the company has to increase the issuance volume to fill the rights issue. In fact, Mysco decided the issuance price in KRW with a discount rate applied to the base price, but the current share price has dropped to KRW. advise A person in charge of a listed company said that a capital increase is a double-sided coin, which can benefit if the business prospects are bright, but there is a possibility of loss if a company with poor performance participates in a capital increase. He advised that he should participate in the capital increase after thoroughly understanding where the funds are being spent and carefully examining whether the company's performance is improving and its business prospects.

This is because, amid the steady growth of the domestic semiconductor industry, a significant amount of investment in related fields is expected this year.

We have established a strategy to target the curtain wall market with a focus on modern buildings through the technology developed in-house. The technology is already being applied to the design of occupant buildings in Sejong City prior to the contract. CEO Son said that he expects sales of the cleanroom equipment sector to increase significantly this year, and that the curtain wall will also find a breakthrough with solar technology. As the business environment becomes difficult, it is necessary to quickly secure new growth engines. Although it returned to the operating surplus last year, it suffered an operating loss for the first time since its establishment as competition for low-priced orders in the curtain wall sector overheated due to the sluggish economy. He is emphasizing the spirit of restart to prepare for a leap forward. The purpose is to secure a growth engine by promoting management innovation and new business under the broad framework of leaping to become a global company in the high-tech eco-friendly construction field. He decided that he had to make a commitment to change in the rapidly changing business environment like these days, so he started a restart campaign for employees. He emphasized that this year will be the first year of a new leap forward with the thought that it is always a crisis. Reporter Yoon Kyung-hwan .. The emergence of Korean mesh is not far away.

326,"Deterioration of profitability due to increase in cost of sales Risk of capital erosion remains despite free reduction The Bell|This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. Acutech's financial structure has deteriorated since last year. As sales decreased, profitability deteriorated, including operating and net losses, which led to capital erosion and an increase in the debt-to-equity ratio. However, last year, sales plummeted to billions of won as overseas sales decreased due to a contraction in global market demand. Last year's sales of semiconductor lead frame, the company's flagship product, were 100 million won, down from the previous year. Acutech recorded an operating loss of 100 million won and a net loss of 100 million won last year. Although the sales decreased, the cost of sales remained at the same level as last year, and the decrease in sales was recognized as an operating loss. Acutech imports copper coils, a raw material for leadframes, from Japan's Towa and Hitachi Cables. The price of copper coil was 10,000 won per year, but it rose to 10,000 won per year, and then rose to 10,000 won at the end of last year. As a result, Acutech's COGS-to-sales ratio, which was at a level, increased until last year. As the operating loss and net loss for the period surged, the capital erosion became serious. Acutech has been in a state of capital erosion since 2008, but the capital erosion rate exceeded . Acutech's total capital decreased significantly from 100 million won at the end of last year to 100 million won at the end of last year. Finally, last month, Acutech implemented a free-of-charge reduction in capital by two. Initially, the capital increase was considered, but the capital increase was not successful as the company suffered internal woes, such as changing the CEO several times due to a dispute over the company's management rights. Through the free reduction, the paid-in capital was reduced from 100 million won to 100 million won, and the capital erosion was temporarily resolved. There was also a profit of KRW 100 million in potato gain. However, Acutech is still in danger of capital erosion despite the reduction. That's because performance shows no signs of improving. Acutech recorded sales of 100 million won in the quarter, operating loss of 100 million won, and net loss of 100 million won. The capital increased through capital increase through capital increase and capital increase was used to deal with the quarterly loss. If the quarterly net loss is more than 100 million won, Acutech will fall into a state of capital erosion again. The debt ratio also increased rapidly. Acutech's debt-to-equity ratio maintained a stable level through the year. However, it rose sharply towards the end of last year and rose until the fourth quarter of this year. This is because equity decreased due to an increase in net loss due to poor performance, but debt did not change significantly. An official from the KOSDAQ market headquarters said that it is impossible to highlight a specific item as a reason for designation because several variables are considered when designating stocks to alert investors. After making the premise, he said that Acutech's debt-to-equity ratio, profitability, and capital erosion may have had an effect on the designation of stocks to alert investors.

387,"Eduence, a private academy operator, is having a hard time finding a new owner. After the close of the business day, Eduence posted a correction on the signing of a stock transfer agreement involving a change in the largest shareholder. The balance payment date, originally scheduled for last month, has been changed to an undecided. In relation to this contract, Eduence has urged the contracting parties to notify the result of whether the remaining payment has been performed several times, but has not yet received a response to the result. Currently, the largest shareholder of Eduence is GT Industrial, a management consulting firm. GT Industrial signed a transfer contract with Nawoon Technology, a management consulting firm, on last month, which involves a change in the largest shareholder of Eduence's 10,000 shares for 100 million won. However, Naun Technology is not paying the remaining 100 million won until the balance payment date has passed. This is not the first time that Naun Technology's transaction payment has been delayed like the number of promises made for Naun Technology's payment. It was decided to pay the remaining balance of 100 million won by the date of the shareholders' meeting. However, Eduence announced through a correction notice on the 1st of last month that Nawoon Technology decided to pay the down payment on the day of the month later than the original promise. In addition, through a correction announcement on the last month, it was announced that the balance of the original balance to be paid before the regular general meeting of shareholders was to be paid only 100 million won as an interim payment before the regular general meeting of shareholders, and the balance was to be paid on the same day. And this time, Naun Technology failed to pay the balance of 100 million won on the promised date. The securities industry analyzes this because Eduence has been designated as an investment alert by the Korea Exchange. Eduence was newly designated as a ventilation item while designating a publicly traded company. As the news became known, the stock price of Eduence fell to the won level for two days in a row. From the point of view of Naun Technology, which decided to take over the stake in Eduence at KRW per share, it can be thought that the stock price has fallen too much. On the other hand, there is a view that Naun Technology may have known in advance that Eduence would be designated as a ventilation item. Because of this, some say that Naun Technology is not paying the remaining balance, but is not able to. He became the largest shareholder by taking over the stake of a third party other than CEO Ha Tae-yoon, who was the existing largest shareholder. CEO Ha, who was the largest shareholder at the time, had most of his stocks provided as collateral to the financial sector, but GT Industrial took over them through an over-the-counter purchase. However, GT Industrial transferred all of its shares to Naun Technology on Monday, just a week later. Eduence's largest shareholder changed twice within a week. For this reason, some believe that Naun Technology, who knows all about this situation, could have guessed that Eduence was already designated as a ventilator from the time Naun Technology signed a contract to acquire Eduence shares. He said that he had a history of delaying payment several times.

432,"A high-quality small and medium-sized company that was making billions of dollars in surplus was quickly shut down due to embezzlement The CEO insisted on intervening in organized violent loan sharks behind the boss who had no room for himself. Suspicions are being raised that SBM was in danger of being delisted due to sudden embezzlement and that related gangs and loan sharks were involved. Headquarters raided. It is known that the search and seizure was because the CEO of the company caught the charges of embezzling 100 million won, including 100 million won in transferable deposit certificates, 100 million won in deposits. There are suspicions that loan sharks are involved. Many of those who said they wanted to save the company also promoted KOSDAQ companies, and minority shareholders say that they cannot be trusted because they have a history of being delisted in the process. SBM, which produces counterfeit money detectors by attracting gangster bond funds, has been embroiled in rumors since the founder sold its management rights at the end of last year. The company that acquired the management rights of SBM at the end of last year had only 100 million won in capital, but it took over SBM by attracting more than 100 million won of bond funds. An accounting firm that did this rejected the audit opinion on the grounds that it had weaknesses in its internal accounting management system. Rejection of the audit opinion is the reason for delisting. The exact status of SBM is known since the former CEO accused the current CEO. For a building that C and SBM said they had acquired through internal reservations, a sale contract had never even been discussed. The 100 million won paid as a down payment has already disappeared. Judging from the circumstances revealed so far, it seems that the current CEO has stolen the company's money, but in reality, Mr. is only a vice president, officials familiar with the company explain. claimed that the company does not even have a room of its own, and as in numerous cases of embezzlement of KOSDAQ companies, Mr. is merely an outward CEO and claimed that the Jeonju gangster, a loan shark who circulated SBM after the incident, was involved. is said to have been captured to some extent. According to industry insiders, the police are known to have obtained transcripts of some gangs discussing embezzlement and manipulation of stock prices for SBM. Normalization is not easy After many twists and turns, SBM signed a re-audit contract with an accounting firm. Until the re-audit, the stolen assets can be recovered and an article can be rehabilitated if an appropriate opinion is received. However, the reality is that it seems difficult at the moment. The Hanmi Accounting Firm, which had rejected an audit opinion to SBM, has placed an order to replace the current management if it wants to be re-audited. SBM accepted this and nominated the directors. In this regard, a general shareholders' meeting was held and all were appointed. However, minority shareholders claim that the newly appointed directors are related to the former management's largest shareholder. There are even suspicions that some of the board members are related to the delisting of another KOSDAQ company. The chairman, who appeared on the surface to acquire Manchuria shares of SBM stock at the end of last month, is saying that he will normalize the company, but the chairman also has two listed companies in the past. There is a history of suffering after taking over. Two companies the chairman was involved in suffered delisting, and one was withdrawn. For this reason, minority shareholders are in conflict with the opinion that they believe in the chairman and that they do not believe it. Ultimately, whether the accounting firm will accept the newly appointed management and the sincerity of the chairman is emerging as a variable. It is not known whether the chairman invested funds to revive SBM, which was in crisis of delisting, or whether he lent funds to the existing largest shareholder and then acted late when it was in danger of being sold out.

436,더벨|이 기사는 월일 자본시장 미디어 머니투데이 에 출고된 기사입니다.상장폐지 위기에 몰린 에스비엠의 경영진과 소액주주가 경영권을 놓고 신경전을 벌이고 있다.사측과 소액주주는 모두 회사 정상화를 희망하고 있다. 하지만 정상화 방안에 대한 견해 차이로 입장 차이를 좁히지 못하고 있다. 서로 회사의 이사회를 선점하기 위해 물밑 작업을 펼치고 있다. 결국 다음주 개최될 주주총회에서의 표대결이 관전 포인트가 될 전망이다.에스비엠 의결권 현황은에스비엠은 오는 일 안양 본사에서 주주총회를 속개한다. 지난달 일 회사측에서 주주총회를 연기했기 때문이다. 이번 주총은 김철수 대표 등 경영진과 소액주주들이 얼마큼 자신에게 유리한 의결권을 모았느냐는 점이 최대 변수로 작용할 전망이다.에스비엠의 작년 말 기준 발행주식 총수는 만주며 의결권 행사주식은 만주다. 주주총회에 상정된 안건을 통과시키기 위해서는 발행주식 총수의 분의과 참석 의결권의 분를 동시에 만족해야 한다.현재 회사 최대주주인 트루트라이엄프는 지난 월일 최종관 전 대표에게 경영권과 보유주식을 인수한 만큼 최 전 대표의 의결권 만주를 위임받은 상황이다.두 번째로 의결권을 많이 쥔 곳은 자산운용이다. 자산운용은 지난달 일 보유 중인 에스비엠의 주식을 전량 매각했다. 에스비엠의 주식이 거래정지 되기 거래일 전이다. 하지만 주총 의결권은 연말 기준으로 하기 때문에 총 만주의 의결권은 여전히 보유하고 있다. 자산운용은 이사 선임의 건 등 주총 안건에 대해 대부분 반대 의견을 행사한다고 공시한 상황이다.박지훈씨를 필두로 소액주주측에서 확보한 의결권은 만 주 내외로 추정된다. 인터넷 카페 등에서 모인 소액주주들은 지난달 일 열린 주총장에서 연락처와 주소를 주고 받으며 더욱 공고해진 것으로 알려졌다.이같이 드러난 의결권을 제외하고 잠재된 물량이 만 주 가량이다. 최근 에스비엠의 자사주 만주를 매입한 석진호씨는 주총을 위한 주주명부폐쇄 이후 주식을 취득한 까닭에 의결권을 인정받지 못한다.자산운용과 소액주주측이  정도로 현 경영진에  가량 의결권이 앞서있지만 의사를 표명하지 않은 만주의 의결권을 누가 더 많이 확보하는냐에 따라 일 주총장에서 희비가 엇갈리게 된다.소액주주 의견 엇갈려...일까지 감사의견 변경돼야 상장 유지일 주총에서의 최대 변수는 역시 소액주주다. 소액주주들읜 크게 두 부류로 나눠져 있다. 이번 주총을 무사히 넘겨 상장폐지 가능성을 줄이자는 입장과 다시 한 번 주총을 연기해 현 경영진과 무관한 새로운 이사진을 선임하자는 입장이다. 양측 모두 에스비엠의 상장폐지를 막자는 목표는 동일하다.온건파는 우선 회사측에 힘을 실어줘 상장폐지를 막아보자는 입장이다. 회사 경영진은 이번 주총에서 안건으로 올렸던 이사선임안만 통과시켜 새로운 이사진을 구성해 상장폐지만은 막아보자고 주주들에게 호소하고 있다. 물론 특별결의가 필요한 정관변경안은 부결시키겠다는 입장이다. 박지훈씨 등 소액주주들의 입장을 일정부분 수용한 셈이다.주총을 통해 새로운 이사진이 구성되면 한국거래소 상장위원회나 재감사 의견에 영향을 미칠 수 있다고 보기 때문이다. 이후 임시 주총을 열고 새로운 이사진을 뽑자고 강경파에 제시한 상황이다. 현 경영진은 상장폐지 사유가 된 감사 의견거절을 돌리기 위해 재감사를 요청했고 한미회계법인은 이를 수용했다.반면 박지훈씨를 필두로 강경파는 현 경영진은 물론 이사후보들 추천된 사람들도 신뢰할 수 없다는 입장이다. 이들은 일 주총에서 일간 연회를 결정하고 소액주주들의 뜻을 살려 회사를 정상화 시킬 수 있는 투명한 경영진을 다시 구성하자는 입장을 나타냈다. 신규 이사선임안을 공고하고 주 후 주총을 속개해도 상장위원회가 열리는 일까지 모든 일정을 소화할 수 있다는 계산이다.박지훈씨는 현 경영진이 진정 회사 정상화를 위한다면 소액주주들이 추천한 명과 현 경영진이 추천한 명으로 이사진을 구성하고 대표이사도 소액주주들이 추천해야 할 것이라고 제안했다. 그는 이어 이후 횡령배임 등 각종 소송이 종료되고 진짜 회사 주인이 나타나면 그쪽에 경영권을 이양하는 수순을 밟을 것이라고 밝혔다.이들과 다른 의견을 나타내고 있는 온건파는 주총을 주 가까이 연회한다며 상장위원회가 열리지 않고 바로 정리매매 절차에 들어갈 수 있다며 반발하고 있다온건파 관계자는 에스비엠은 월일까지 한미회계법인으로부터 적정 또는 한정 의견을 받아야만 상장위원회가 열리게 된다며 회계법인 입장에서 횡령배임 혐의가 있는 현 경영진이 그대로 유지하고 있는 상황에서 어떻게 감사의견을 변경해 줄 수 있겠느냐고 반문했다. 그는 이어 결국 주총 재연회는 대안이 아니며 상장 유지의 마지막 카드는 일 열리는 주총에서 기존 후보를 이사로 선임해 새로운 이사회를 구성하는 것이라고 주장했다.한미회계법인 에스비엠 생사여탈권 쥐고 있어마지막 칼자루는 한미회계법인이 쥐고 있다. 에스비엠을 재감사했는데도 기존 의견거절을 고수한다면 현 경영진과 소액주주측의 갈등 여부와 상관없이 상장폐지로 직행하게 된다. 한미회계법인은 감사범위의 제한과 계속기업 존속능력에 대한 불확실성 등의 이유로 에스비엠의 감사의견을 거절한 상황이다.그러나 증권업계는 에스비엠의 회계연도 재무제표에 문제가 없을 것으로 예측하고 있다. 최대주주가 바뀐 지난 월일 이후 내부 회계관리 시스템이 문제가 돼 감사의견에 영향을 미쳤다고 봐야한다는 것이다. 현 경영진이 교체되면 감사의견이 적정 또는 한정으로 나올 가능성이 크다는 논리다.증권업계 관계자는 한미회계법인에서 현 경영진을 배제하고 새로운 이사회 구성을 요구한 점에 주목해야 한다며 이를 위해서는 경영진과 소액주주들이 뜻을 모아야 가능할 것이라고 말했다. 핫포토 갤러리  에스비엠 소액주주 일단 상장폐지 막자 에스비엠 상장유지 위해 안간힘박제언기자 저작권자  돈이 보이는 리얼타임 뉴스 머니투데이 무단전재 및 재배포 금지

Among them, the percentage of positive opinions was ., which decreased by . The opposite opinion was only a .point decrease compared to the previous year. In the midst of this, recently, there are managers who are raising their voices for investors, attracting attention. A representative example is Truston Asset Management, which strongly opposes Mando's capital increase in Halla Construction. The manager explained that it is an asset manager's natural duty to try to prevent the investment company's management from infringing on investors' interests.

439,"SBM announced on the day that it had received a refusal of an audit opinion from the Hanmi Accounting Firm. The KOSDAQ Market Headquarters of the Korea Exchange said that SBM fell under the reason for delisting as it received a rejection of opinion due to the limited scope of the audit opinion and uncertainty about the company's ability to continue.

440,"The Bell|This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. The company's normalization comes first. Only delisting should be prevented Minority shareholders of SBM, a KOSDAQ listed company, have joined the efforts to revive the company. It is intended to solve the overall difficulties of SBM in solidarity with minority shareholders. Minority shareholders who have different voices from the current management seem to agree with the goal of maintaining the listing. Mr. Jang Cheol, who owns only SBM stock, had an interview with The Bell of Money Today and discussed this with the company. He said that he needed to see an amicable compromise at the general meeting of shareholders. The interview was attended by several minority shareholders, including Mr. Jang, who owned tens of thousands of SBM stocks. As the Hanmi Accounting Firm decided to re-audit SBM, some minority shareholders are also newly elected at this general meeting to maintain their listing. They agreed that they should choose . If the appointment of directors is rejected at the general shareholders' meeting, the existing management will remain at SBM. Since the auditor has raised a problem with the internal control system, there is a high possibility that the audit opinion will be negative if the existing management remains. We believe that this shareholders' meeting can be an important starting point for maintaining the listing. For this reason, even if it is a temporary measure, the company will pass the appointment of directors and reject the remaining amendments to the articles of incorporation. Once a new board of directors is appointed, it will lead the company in the direction desired by minority shareholders through an extraordinary general meeting. In order to maintain the listing, the company will agree with the opinions of minority shareholders. Mr. Jang said that if the proposal for the appointment of new directors is rejected at this general meeting, the company will survive until an extraordinary meeting of shareholders through a special resolution asserted by shareholders with different opinions. Minority shareholders who responded to the interview were concerned that if the current management were maintained as it is, negative comments would come from the re-audit, which could lead to delisting. There is a reaction that SBM is highly likely to become a prey for corporate hunters if the sale proceeds after delisting. Although it is a company with a high proportion of exports through the business of counterfeiting banknote recognition machine, there is a high possibility that overseas customers will also stop trading with companies that have exited the stock market. Then, the company claimed that it should reveal all the circumstances it had committed in the past and seek a win-win way to improve internal stability and external credibility by opening everything in the future. received.

442,"As it was revealed that Asset Management had sold all of its stake in SBM, suspicions are being raised that it may have minimized losses by recognizing SBM's inside information in advance. Il SBM stakes were intensively disposed of. Asset Management sold Manchuria on the stock exchange prior to the announcement, on the day when the disclosure of bad news was submitted, such as the disposal of treasury stock and the alleged embezzlement and breach of trust of the current CEO Kim Cheol-soo. In addition, he poured out the remaining 10,000 shares into the market and washed his hands. The total number of shares sold by Asset Management in the two days was 10,000, which is more than the total number of shares held by Asset Management before. The purchase of some SBM stocks in Inil is also somewhat difficult to understand. This is because it can be viewed as a so-called water-fighting investment to buy a falling stock price at a low price. In addition, through the exercise of voting rights, they voted against approval of financial statements and changes to the Articles of Incorporation in SBM's general shareholders' meeting agenda, faithfully fulfilling the role of a major shareholder. The interpretation of the stock market is that it is not easy to understand the sudden disposal of the stake while performing the transaction. In response, an asset management official explained that the purchase order was placed with SBM as part of the product management because it was a basket transaction. Most of the holdings were sold on Thursday and Friday last week, and the announcement was made on the date the funds were received. He replied that he did not sell after knowing the bad news in advance by using insider information. In any case, it is an asset management that wiped out all of SBM's stake, but some losses are unavoidable. After the announcement of holdings, the average purchase price and average sale price of asset management estimated through SBM trading history are KRW won, respectively. Even assuming that the company suffered a loss of KRW per share, the loss amounted to KRW 100 million. An asset management official said that it was accumulated in KRW at the time of the initial announcement, and there were profits from subsequent transactions, and some losses in the process of changing the major shareholder after additional acquisitions. there was However, he explained that there was no major loss in the end because most of them were sold on the Won."

454,"The Bell|This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. Institutional investors including minority shareholders put the brakes on SBM's strange behavior. Minority shareholders are arguing that SBM's use of funds or management behavior is out of common sense. Even the institutions that have been steadily buying SBM stocks for several months are turning their backs on SBM. A minority shareholder in Japan, Park Ji-hoon, started recommending a proxy exercise of voting rights to reject major issues such as changes to the articles of association prior to SBM's regular general shareholders' meeting. The reason is that the company's stock price is undervalued compared to its intrinsic value and that the interests of minority shareholders are underestimated by closed management. argued that the reserved cash was used for the cancellation of undervalued treasury stocks. According to Park's argument, SBM management did not make any investments for growth over the past several years and retained most of the annual cash flow in-house. As a result, free cash continues to increase, and net cash equivalents amount to 100 million won. He then purchased unnecessary real estate with the company's reserve cash, which has the lowest procurement cost, and issuance of stock convertible bonds such as bonds with warrants that require procurement costs. To prevent damage to shareholder value, Mr. Park rejected the amendment to the articles of incorporation and the appointment of directors appointed by the management, and dismissed the board of directors as a minority shareholder movement to prevent damage to shareholder value. They expressed their position that they would proceed. Here, the major shareholder, Asset Management, also expressed opposition to the agenda for the shareholders' meeting. Among SBM's shareholders' meeting agenda, Asset Management voted against the approval of financial statements, the number of types of stocks, the issuance of bonds convertible with warrants, and the appointment of directors. Asset Management has been buying SBM's stock since last month. It was judged that SBM is worth investing in as SBM has continued to grow with stable sales growth and high margins for several years. Asset Management, which repeatedly bought and sold stocks until mid-February and bought up to 10,000 shares, recently sold about 10,000 shares in one month. As of Monday, the number of stocks held has decreased to 10,000 shares.

455,"The Bell|This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. There is a lot of noise about the building recently purchased by SBM, which had a major shareholder change earlier this year. This is because the financial authorities, including shareholders, cannot verify the key documents related to this even though the company's money was used to purchase real estate. announced that they would purchase it. This is equivalent to the amount of the company's total assets of 100 million won. The counterparty to the transaction is Kim Geum-soon, Lee Ho-jae, Kim Jung-il, Kim Geum-ja, etc. of Innout AMC. SBM paid a down payment of 100 million won to the counterparty last day and plans to pay the remaining 100 million won on the next day. He explained that the move was due to the lack of space for use and the expiration of the lease contract of the current leased building, and explained that it was to improve the living environment of employees by acquiring their own building. The company is currently located in Anyang, Gyeonggi-do. However, it is pointed out that the problem is that SBM did not submit an external evaluation opinion on Sambournaise Plus to financial authorities such as the Korea Exchange or the Financial Supervisory Service. From the perspective of SBM shareholders, it means that they are in a situation where they have to trust only the company's words whether the building they want to purchase is for billions of won or billions of won. For this reason, shareholders continue to inquire as to whether the price purchased by SBM as an authorized broker in the vicinity of Sambourneissance Plus is the correct market price. He said that only documents and contracts are to be received from the exchange and disclosed, and there is nothing the exchange can do beyond that. The purpose is to believe the documents submitted by the company first. An official from the Financial Supervisory Service sent an external evaluation opinion to SBM as soon as possible. However, stock market experts are voicing concerns that investors are the ones who will suffer the full damage if problems arise in the future. He said that there were many parts that were post-measures rather than pre-measures, and that it was necessary to go in a way that could minimize the damage to investors through institutional improvement.

The company was on the verge of delisting due to the refusal of an external auditor's audit opinion, and True Triumph, which acquired SBM without a penny of its own, was accused of embezzlement and breach of trust. did. The Korea Exchange explained that if SBM does not resolve the reason for refusal of opinion and file an objection by next month, it will go through the delisting process. Last year, the company achieved sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won. However, the situation changed rapidly as the largest shareholder changed to True Triumph last month. True Triumph, with a capital of 100 million won, secured management rights to SBM through a merger and acquisition method without capital. He bought the stake owned by Choi Jong-gwan for 100 million won and borrowed the entire amount of the acquisition from an individual. Director Kim Jeong-hwan, a registered director of SBM, sued CEO Kim Cheol-soo at Anyang Branch of the Suwon District Prosecutors' Office on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust.

464,"The management of KOSDAQ companies such as SBMPSMC continues to engage in unhealthy acts such as embezzlement. In particular, some companies have even raised suspicions that gangs were involved in the process of extorting company money. There is growing concern that the entire KOSDAQ market, which reflects the expectations of the new government policy, will be sold this year. According to the electronic disclosure system of the Financial Supervisory Service in Japan, listed corporations that have been accused of embezzlement and breach of trust by management this year have been charged with prosecution and fined. Total place. This is a decrease of about half compared to the same period last year. However, if you include the places where the embezzlement and breach of trust investigation is currently underway, SBM, a manufacturer specializing in counterfeit bills, is accused of embezzling 100 million won of company money by its management. This happened last month when the management of SBM was replaced. At that time, the largest shareholder was changed to True Triumph, and the current management is accused of stealing assets of more than 100 million won, such as deposits and transferable deposit certificates, and entrusting it to a debt collector as collateral to raise funds for the acquisition. Kim and Jo, who are believed to be behind the merger, are said to have drawn most of the acquisition funds from the Myeong-dong bond market in Seoul, aiming for KRW 100 million in cash equivalents owned by the company and market capital gains through stock manipulation. The police are currently investigating whether gangs were involved in this process of extorting company money. Last day, True Triumph, the largest shareholder of the company, applied to the Suwon District Court to initiate corporate rehabilitation procedures.

466,"The Bell | This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. A successful company collapsed in an instant. This is what the stock market says about SBM, a KOSDAQ-listed company that has recently undergone delisting procedures. SBM is the only stock market As a manufacturer of counterfeit currency identification devices, exports accounted for the largest portion of sales. Although the sales volume was not large, around 100 million won, the operating profit margin was close. It was a net worth company with cash equivalents of billions of won and debt ratio of only Daejeon. This SBM showed abnormal signs after the change in its largest shareholder a month ago. True Triumph, the largest shareholder, formally took over the company through an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in the middle of last month. After ten days, the position of CEO Kim Jung-hwan, who was appointed as CEO, was removed. The justification was to strengthen quick and efficient management activities through the unification of the decision-making structure. However, two months later, former CEO Kim Jeong-hwan sued Kim Cheol-soo, current SBM CEO, on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. For the new business, it also promoted external financing such as bonds with warrants and convertible bonds. The company is pursuing the purchase of a new floor for 100 million won. Although he has already spent 100 million won as a down payment, the actual whereabouts are unknown. This is one of the reasons why Hanmi Accounting Firm rejected SBM's audit opinion. The financial authorities are also responsible for SBM's failure as well as internal problems. not. This is because of limited information. A publicly traded company is not a private company. From the time of listing, it consists of an unspecified number of shareholders. In important company matters such as mergers and capital reduction, minority shareholders can express their opinions by exercising their stock appraisal rights. However, in the transfer of management rights through the sale of the largest shareholder's stake, minority shareholders cannot express any opinions. If you don't like the temple, the middle class is telling you to leave. If you miss the time to leave, you may incur great damage. This is why financial authorities must thoroughly check in advance to protect investors when a listed company is sold. Financial authorities should help the right acquirer to lead the existing listed companies. From the source of the acquisition funds to the review of the acquirer's reputation, thorough deliberation by the financial authorities is required. True Triumph, the largest shareholder of SBM, has less than 100 million won in total assets. For this reason, there are still doubts in the market over the source of the acquisition funds. There are even all kinds of rumors circulating about the actual acquirer. If there had been a prior deliberation by the financial authorities, such noise would not have arisen. The disclosure system of the financial authorities is also a problem. SBM announced its intention to purchase a building worth 100 million won. In general, an external appraisal report is attached to the real estate purchase announcement. This is a measure to prevent embezzlement of the company. However, SBM made an announcement and did not submit an external appraisal report to the Korea Exchange or the Financial Supervisory Service. Both institutions blame only the system. Explain that when a company submits the minutes of the board of directors and a contract, it has no choice but to disclose it. The problem that investors can be deceived by disclosure seems to be behind the scenes. As an accounting firm that rejects an audit opinion due to insufficient documents, it is necessary to change the disclosure system meticulously. If you want a good company to stay in the market for a long time, it has to be. Hot photo gallery SBM Minority shareholders panic, who believed that SBM was eventually delisted.

467,"The reason SBM recently decided to purchase the basement and ground floors for 100 million won is because of the high rent. How do we see the intention of purchasing the floor of an officetel floor and using it as an office building? SBM, a manufacturer of counterfeit banknotes, is moving to the mountains as the owner changes. When the new management decided to purchase a building equal to the company's total assets, minority shareholders and institutions arose. Asset Management owns SBM stock . Umph's stake is .. However, the purchase amount of 100 million won is borrowed from an undisclosed individual, and the borrowing period is only one year. The sum of SBM's other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents is 100 million won. It is like taking a debt and acquiring a company with cash equivalent to that amount. The total capital of True Triumph, an information processing system builder, is only 100 million won. Shareholders, who had doubts about True Triumph's acquisition funds, are raising questions about transparency and efficiency when the management suddenly decided to purchase the building worth 100 million won. As a residential and commercial officetel, the basement and ground floors were contracted for KRW 100 million. The number of employees at SBM is as of last year. This means that each employee will work with real estate worth billions of won. It is common for manufacturers such as SBM to either build office buildings on the outskirts of the city to conserve rent, such as factories, or to acquire apartment-type factories at low prices. It is difficult to comprehend the inverse estimate based on the recent auction price of some of the floors of the building. Accordingly, attention is also being paid to the relationship between True Triumph and the seller of the building, including Mr. Kim Geum-soon of In-N-Out AMC. In the end, the KOSDAQ market headquarters requested an inquiry and disclosure about the alleged embezzlement and breach of trust of the current SBM CEO Kim Chul-soo. The designation of a public corporation in unfaithfulness was also foreshadowed for the sudden disposal of 10,000 shares of treasury stock for 100 million won without a response to the previous inquiry disclosure. They clearly oppose the agenda. The shareholders' meeting includes the addition of new businesses, such as overseas resource development, and a plan to delete the text of the articles of incorporation, which requires an announcement prior to the allocation of warrants to investors other than existing shareholders. Easing the issuance price and issuance conditions of the warrants The board of directors decides on a plan to shorten the exercise period from one year to six months after issuance. It is said that it is an unthinkable decision as a manager to make up for the reduced cash after purchasing a building with high warrants. Meanwhile, SBM stock, which had reversed in an uptrend at the beginning of the day, showed weakness in the afternoon and ended the transaction at the closing price of the previous day. Asset Management, which has been increasing its stake in SBM since last year, has shifted to selling after the end of the month.

470,"Rumors abound that companies that have been delisted or are in the process of being delisted from internet stock cafes can be re-listed and that they have a lot of assets, so they need to invest in consolidation. This is due to the fact that the number of stocks that have gone through the delisting process has risen sharply in the season of the recent audit report.

There are so few companies that have been relisted after delisting in the history of the domestic stock market, such as Dongyang Steel C&B Tech, Aegang Limetech, Jinro Mando, and others. No company has succeeded in re-listing after a year or so. Another problem is that re-listing takes a considerable amount of time. It took several years for Mando, an automobile parts maker with annual sales of KRW trillion, to relist. Experts point out that we should not be swayed by rumors that it has a lot of assets. This is because, based on precedent, most of the remaining assets are likely to be taken by senior creditors, and even if the shareholders recover some of their investment, the share of minority shareholders is not set very much. Even if there is a loss, it is often said that it is the best way to recover the minimum investment through closing trading, and there are many assets. On the other hand, during this audit season, companies that are expelled due to reasons such as refusal of an audit opinion are expected to close.

529,"From the New Year, companies are starting to implement potatoes. The reason they publicly publicize the reduction in measures is the improvement of the financial structure. But if you look inside, the story is a little different. Among the companies that announced the potato reduction plan this year, one promoted the sale of the potato and the management right at the same time. Withas, a telecommunication equipment company, announced that the largest shareholder had changed within one day of the announcement of the potato merger, which would be a common stock. Last day, Withas announced that the largest shareholder had changed from Chun-ho Park and others to Young-man Lee. KIC, a facility manufacturer, is also working on potatoes. On the last day of last month, KIC signed a contract to transfer KIC shares held by the existing largest shareholder, Ace Engineering & Construction, to Nara Ace Holdings. Instead of reducing the capital, it is a method of wiping off the deficit through potato arbitrage. A proper potato reduction serves as a new opportunity for both companies and shareholders in that it improves the financial structure of companies. There are times when it is used When a company is sold to another investor. People who want to buy a company are reluctant to buy a company with a complicated equity relationship. Companies with too many minority shareholders' equity are also subject to avoidance. At this time, if the reduction is implemented, ordinary shareholders can leave and the stake relationship can be organized more simply. This is why the stock price often falls to the lower limit the day after the announcement of the reduction. Withas also closed the market by lowering the price to the limit right after the market opened on the day after the announcement of the potato. KIC also fell to the lowest price on the news of the decision to reduce the potato last day. An official in the securities industry said that it is inevitable to cut potatoes, but pushing both potato and potato at the same time seems to be the intention to reduce the number of minority shareholders. He explained that although he can get cash through the company, ordinary shareholders have no choice but to bear the damage caused by the decline in their shares. He pointed out that there are a lot of people who go out on TV, but it is necessary to take a closer look at the real reason for the potato.

532,"Loss cases follow one after another, but there are no institutional protections. Even though the largest shareholder of a KOSDAQ-listed company received a loan using his stake as collateral, there are cases in which investors lose money by hiding it or notifying it too late. However, it was found that the institutional device to block this actually did not function properly. According to the Financial Supervisory Service and the Korea Exchange in Japan, on the last day, the largest shareholder of a solar power plant construction company, CEO Choi Ki-hyeok, and special related parties reduced the stake from . to . announced This is because the creditor sold the stock as collateral because CEO Choi failed to repay the loan with his stake as collateral in a timely manner. Chun-ho Park, the largest shareholder of Withas, also borrowed the entire amount of Manchuria as collateral, but was unable to repay it, so he was the largest shareholder. It has lost its position. In the middle of signing a contract for the transfer of stocks and management rights, a counter sale occurred at Seunghwa Luxury Construction. Seoul MS, the largest shareholder, received a down payment of 100 million won from Kim Seong-jin in January last year and handed over 10,000 shares equivalent to . In order to take over the remaining Manchuria, Kim borrowed money from Jeong Byeong-chan, using the stock he had previously purchased as collateral. However, as the company's stock price rose, Mr. Jeong sold a lot of collateral, and Mr. Kim announced this year that he entrusted the stock he had acquired as collateral. This is in violation of the rules of the Capital Market Act, which must be notified within one day. It is an extension of the fact that investors suffered considerable losses last year from stock-backed loans from the largest shareholders of KOSDAQ-listed companies such as Aminologics, Hansung Lcomtech, and Hanjin PNC. Loans are continuous. This year alone, only KOSDAQ-listed companies have announced that the largest shareholder has entrusted more than his own stake as collateral. In particular, Comico's largest shareholder, Jeon Seon-kyu, provided all of his 10,000 shares as collateral to financial institutions. Following this, Ahn Seung-han, the largest shareholder of Fidelix, was also secured with a stake in Manchuria as collateral. The largest shareholders, such as Danal Park Seong-chan, Komi Farm Yang Yong-jin Homecast, and Jang Byung-kwon, also borrowed money using the company's stock as collateral. In fact, Chun-ho Park, the largest shareholder of Withas, announced the fact of the stock-secured loan only after the creditor sold the secured stock on the first day of last year. In particular, Mr. Park intentionally left the date of signing the contract blank and hid the timing of the contract. An official from the Financial Supervisory Service also said that it is highly likely that the disclosure was intended to evade the fact that the disclosure obligation was violated when there was pressure on counter-trading. On the other hand, under the current law, those who conceal or falsely disclose their shares after borrowing them as collateral by the largest shareholder are sentenced to up to a year in prison. may be subject to a fine of up to Rs. However, in most cases, it ends with a caution or warning from the Financial Supervisory Service. In fact, the FSS reported only one case to the prosecution for this reason over the past year. In response, an official from the Financial Supervisory Service's corporate disclosure system said that since the disclosure of stock-backed loans became compulsory after the Capital Market Act was introduced, it is still necessary to disclose it.

541,"The stock price of Celltrion, a company with market capitalization on the KOSDAQ market, plummeted due to the sale of accounting opacity. This is because an atmosphere has been formed among individual investors that stocks must be sold before counter-trading. Counter-trading is when a shareholder entrusts his stock with a loan, but the value of the stock falls and creditors sell the stock. Even during the financial crisis last year, many listed companies suffered a headache from counter-trading. A mobile phone parts maker's share price, which was originally in the Won range, fell to Won Won due to a foreign sell-off, and after that, it was pushed back to Won Won as a result of counter-trading. Counter-trading is something that can drop down to a minute in an instant. Investors are terrified, but looking at the recent situation, fear is also exaggerated. If you sell stocks without looking back and forth because you are swept away by fear, it is often the case that only the investor itself loses. Experts recommend carefully reviewing the stock-backed loan contract. There are three major misconceptions about counter-selling. There is a perception that once the collateral ratio falls below the collateral ratio, the creditor sells the stock unconditionally. Usually, the creditor makes a counter sale when the stock value falls below the loan amount. If the value of the stock traded on the stock market is 100 million won, it means considering selling the stock. However, this is only a general guideline, and in most cases, creditors require additional collateral from debtors. It is easy to understand by taking an apartment as an example. A sharp drop in apartment prices does not mean that banks are unconditionally holding an auction. If the owner has the financial power and pays the full interest, he or she will wait. However, if the collateral ratio falls below the loan amount, additional collateral is of course required. However, this too is often a misunderstanding. Stock-backed loans are relatively easy compared to other loans. You only need to check the real stock and check the stock price on the home trading system. For this reason, experts in the securities industry say that some large corporation owners often get stock-backed loans when they need urgent money. Another misconception is that only financial institutions will be treated. As is known about the Celltrion incident, stock-backed loans are also offered by many general companies. To avoid counter-trading It is not easy to predict the possibility of counter-trading, but experts advise that damage can be reduced if you pay attention to several major points. The interest rate differs depending on whether it is finance or finance, and is set differently according to the value of collateral. But basically, no debtor wants to pay a lot of interest. An official of a stock loan company said that these days, there is a lot of liquid money, so the loan interest is cheap. Companies that have made the necessary information but have not provided sufficient information are also of interest. Where the disclosure content changes frequently, it means that the largest shareholder is receiving stock-backed loans from time to time, and companies that do not record details such as interest rates often have contracts with conditions that they do not want to be disclosed. Be careful even if the creditors are unknown companies. Should be. Some private equity consulting firms, so-called boutiques, have caused a scandal by selling the stocks immediately after receiving the stock as collateral without notifying the debtor. Amino Logics, Hansung Lcomtech, Hanjin PNC Withas, etc., who suffered from counter-trading from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, received stock-backed loans from non-institutional financial companies and then faced counter-trading.

542,"As the audit and business report submissions of monthly settlement corporations are completed, companies that are being withdrawn from the stock market are coming out one after another. Samwoo EMC and Humantech Korea were completely encroached on capital. EDID Company was designated as a management item due to refusal to review the semi-annual financial statements, and the delisting was decided as the capital encroachment rate exceeded . The Korea Pacific and the Korea Pacific were both withdrawn from the stock market. Enter technology, which became famous through investment by Seunghwan Hwang, known as Madam Hwang, was also kicked out of the KOSDAQ market. Last month, Spec Korea Spec and SB I&Solomon Spec Daishin Securities Growth Spec were delisted because they could not find a company to be merged with. Daham Tech and Hanil E&C, which are in the process of closing, will be delisted from listing on the next day. Acutech and Uable will also be withdrawn from the Japanese stock market after closing. There are also several listed companies in the crisis of delisting. Glostech Lotte Tourism Development R&L Bio China Gosum, listed on the stock market, is waiting for the Korea Exchange to decide whether to delist after receiving an audit decision.

543,"Source The Korea Exchange Financial Supervisory Service Accounting Corporation There are more audit services in the stock market than in the KOSDAQ market. Companies listed on the stock market and the KOSDAQ market are at risk of being delisted. As a result of receiving the business reports of monthly-settled corporations, several companies revealed that there was a reason for delisting. Among the monthly settlement companies in the KOSPI, companies with reasons for delisting are one. As a result, a reason for delisting occurred in the company. The reason for the delisting occurred is that the company was not qualified as a listed company either because it received an audit opinion from an external auditing firm, an accounting firm, or because its capital was completely eroded. Among these companies, Samil Anjin Samjung Hanyoung Accounting Corporation and other big companies are responsible for accounting audits for all of them. He was in charge of the audit. In terms of market, Bigga accounted for dogs out of all dogs in the stock market, and in the KOSDAQ market, it ranked as dogs out of all dogs. It is attracting attention as it is shown by the proportion and the approached figure. In addition, it indirectly shows that large corporations are in charge of more auditing tasks in the stock market than in the KOSDAQ market. Data Korea Exchange Financial Supervisory Service delisting companies themselves are a huge burden on investors. The greatest responsibility lies with the management that runs the company. While conducting an audit, an accounting firm requests the management to provide empirical data to support the financial statements, and if the company does not disclose the data, the audit opinion is rejected. You cannot change the accounting firm and receive another audit opinion just because it is rejected. The fact that there is no delisting requirement is because it must be proven through re-audit through the accounting firm that submitted the audit opinion and submitted to the Korea Exchange and the Financial Supervisory Service. He explained that he could not change the accounting firm at will because he did not like the opinion of the accounting firm. Because it has to be traded in the over-the-counter market, the liquidity property is lowered, and if there is no demand, it cannot be traded at all. As a result, the fact that it could be delisted itself is a huge burden on investors and causes the stock price to plummet. It fluctuated between the monthly high and low won, but as of the day of the month, it is traded at high won and low won. It means that it has plummeted by almost a minute. There is also a backlash from companies that have caused reasons for delisting. In the stock market, Lotte Tourism Development Glostech R&L Bygo filed an objection. In the KOSDAQ market, Accutech Withas G&ST Yuil Nsys Eduence DS Free Tour Neo Purple GI Bio filed an objection. The Korea Exchange held a listing disclosure committee within one day of receiving the objection to determine whether the stock was delisted or not. A decision on whether to delist or not will be decided within one day from the date of deliberation. Meet the Jose Ilbo news on Naver Newsstand.

This includes Hubyron.

Jenner Systems also made a public announcement of overdue loan payments on two separate occasions last month. For this reason, the stock price, which had exceeded KRW in the beginning of the month, was cut in half in less than a month. Zener Systems' loan delinquency and its plunge began last year.

633,"Recommendation within the issuance limit This year, Mushi Market Insights Mon., .m. pm KOSDAQ listed company Jenner Systems has decided to significantly increase the issuance limit of the issue of paid-in capital issue by apprenticeship allocation, which was within the limit of the number of existing shares. In this regard, it is pointed out that the Financial Supervisory Service's investor protection measures, which recommend keeping the issuance limit within the limit, are being neutralized. According to the Japanese securities industry, Jenner Systems is coming up with a bill to amend the articles of incorporation to expand the cap on capital increase through disciple allocation to the number of existing shares.

667,"Reporter Kim Ho-cheon pointed out that the export to Japan of Jeju Samdasoo, the drinking spring water that caused controversy by entrusting export to a security solution company in the industry, ended in failure. This is because GI Bio failed to export 10,000 thousand, the minimum annual export volume. GI Bio signed a private contract to export Samdasoo to Japan in the presence of Geun-Min Woo at the Jeju Provincial Office meeting room on the first day of last year. The company paid 100 million won as a contract performance deposit, saying that it would export 10,000 Samdasoo every year for the year.

However, this company has only exported Samdasoo worth 10 million won after a year. Suspicions and concerns about the background of the contract were raised, but the development company insisted that there was no problem. At that time, President Oh Jae-yoon of the Jeju Island Development Corporation checked the financial structure of the company and found that it had about 100 billion won in funding. The will of the president to expand the business area is great. He also said that the export contract with GI Bio would be a turning point for Samdasoo exports. Lee Young-woong, secretary general of the Jeju Environmental Movement Association, who requested an investigation into the suspicion of the Samdasoo export contract to Japan to the Jeju Provincial Audit Committee, raised issues with the provincial council and civic groups last year. The management of the Development Corporation, which signed an export contract with Edo, said that they should be held accountable.

There is even a situation in which trading is suspended due to a risky level. In the KOSDAQ market on the day, the stock prices of listed companies that have been designated as investment warnings by the exchange have risen.

671,"The export target of the company's stock management item seems difficult. It was found that the export of the company that signed a contract with Jeju Island to export Jeju Samdasoo to Japan has not occurred. At that time, Jeju Island Development Corporation signed a sales contract with GI Bio to export 10,000 tons of Samdasoo to Japan. The annual export volume is 11,000 tons, and the total export amount is 100 million won. This issue was raised at the Jeju Provincial Assembly last month, but Governor Woo Geun-min only said that he had to wait until the end of the year. He also added that he had paid a security deposit of 100 million won for the export contract. However, GI Bio's export to Japan is not expected to be easy. This is because the internal circumstances of the company are difficult. As the company's stock has already been designated as a management item, a conflict has arisen between minority shareholders and the existing major shareholder. In fact, the price of GI Bio's stock fell to the level of the previous month's overseas mining investment in KRW last month. At the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on the same day, a proposal to reduce capital was proposed, but it was rejected due to opposition from some shareholders.

674,"Fears of exit are coming back to the Wall Street stock market. This is because listed companies unanimously issued their audit opinions ahead of this year's regular general meeting of shareholders, revealing inappropriate opinions and rejection of opinions, which are requirements for the delisting procedure. According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, Following the suspension of stock exchange trading by Lotte Tourism Development for refusal of opinion, Glostech, an information technology-related owner, also declined to comment, putting the company on the verge of exiting the stock market.

He pointed out that if these debts are not repaid, the ability to continue as a going concern becomes uncertain. Glostech received a rejection of opinion from Jeongdong Accounting Firm. In the case of this company, the limitation of the scope of audit was an important reason for refusal. Jeongdong Accounting Firm said that it could not carry out the procedure to confirm important financial transactions due to the limitation of the scope of audit by the company. It explained that it was not possible to gather audit evidence to confirm the adequacy of evaluation and the reality of the amount of short-term loan securities.

675,"A vicious cycle continues, leading to a drop in stock prices by capital increase to raise funds for abusive operation in order to write off urgent debt, rather than funds for facility investment. Although the KOSDAQ market is looking for some vitality, this is because the economic slump in industries except for some booming industries such as electronic parts continues, and the cases of insolvent companies abusing capital increase for corporate revival are continuing. Although the company decided to issue a rights issue, many of these companies' stock prices plummeted after the announcement. In addition, there are about a dozen listed companies that have been delisted or are undergoing substantive review after the capital increase. The listed companies that recently decided to raise capital for working capital are Actoz Soft Nature and Environment Point i SarainHR Stem Science Korea CN Plus Uable CNS Technology. Among the listed companies that decided to increase capital this year, there is a rights issue to raise funds for facility investment by high-quality companies, but some listed companies are under management due to sluggish performance. It is not a fund for investment in a growth business, but rather an emergency supply for securing liquidity for corporate survival or financing for debt relief. Insolvent companies attempted capital increase several times a year to raise operating funds. The number of listed stocks increased significantly, and the performance was not supported, so the stock price continued to fall and was driven into capital erosion. When some have reached the point of delisting, it is a vicious cycle where the ants who put their money in for a jackpot close to speculation lose money. This means that the risk signal of badly listed companies is a capital increase. This year, Enter Technology Enspert Tri-Circle, etc. were delisted after the capital increase. In addition, R&L Bio, GI Bio, Glostech, PSMC, G&ST, Eduence, Luxon Energy, etc. have been delisted or have been suspended. In addition, there are many cases where the stock price falls to the lower limit after the decision to increase capital. ActozSoft's stock price reached a lower limit of 10,000 won, the day after the announcement of a large-scale capital increase of 100 million won. Korea also plunged to the limit of the price limit on the day after the announcement of the capital increase decision. An official in the financial investment industry said that a small amount of capital increase or a capital increase by an unreliable management should be suspicious first, and there is a high risk of being expelled due to poor management. He analyzed that listed companies that depend on shareholders because they could not even transfuse funds from the stock market could be considered to be in a situation where it was difficult to normalize their management even if they raised this amount of funds. .Mid-sized businesses are getting harder to get money. As the false perception that it is a capital increase risk signal is spreading because of some bad listed companies, good listed companies are becoming victims in good faith.
