"Coin stocks, which fall short of the price of gum, are increasing significantly.While the KOSDAQ market has rarely gained strength, with the lowest level of the year, the number of coin stocks with stock prices falling short of the won has increased significantly.According to the Korea Exchange, as of the same day, there were a total of less than KRW coins in the KOSDAQ market. That's an increase compared to dogs earlier this year.Specifically, it is the place where Wonmi Bay is located.Among them, the cheapest stock price was Ocean Global, which was traded at KRW per share until the decision to suspend liquidation sales. The market capitalization is 100 million won.Ocean Global was in the process of liquidating the delisting due to the rejection of the audit opinion, but the scheduled delisting process has been suspended as the company's application for an injunction to ban the delisting of stock certificates was cited last month.Cheil Industrial Investment, which was decided to be delisted, was also undergoing a clearance sale at a won, which is more expensive than Ocean Global, but for the same reason, trading has been suspended since last month.Among the stocks currently traded, Clasta is the lowest. On the same day, the market rose far above the market's growth rate, but the closing price was won.Shinopex Green Tech Hallim Chang-to Hesbon L&Pianus, etc. were named as the disgraceful top players.Experts advised that most low-priced stocks should be especially careful about investment as they move separately from market trends.In particular, investors are required to take a cautious approach as many stocks are designated as management stocks or investment ventilation stocks unfaithful disclosure corporations or are suspended due to embezzlement and breach of trust.Smallcap researchers at a securities firm said, ""Many of the low-priced stocks are designated as management stocks or recent investor-ventilated stocks,"" adding, ""Since these stocks are often driven by individual trading, such as liquidation, it is prohibited to invest.""In fact, among the relevant stocks, transactions related to delisting are suspended, and individual stocks are managed and individual stocks are designated as investment ventilation stocks. In addition, among the non-affiliated companies, individual companies recorded operating profit deficits last year.Kim Ho-yeon, copyright holder, Financial News.

"With the advent of Super Ant, the first time in a securities company to set a record of more than a total number of attendees last month, the story of him has continued on the stock market and has recently become so popular that people call him the god of stocks.The main character of the talk is Jae-sung-gun, who is called the new generation super ant and has attracted more attention as a rare Bok.So who is he and why is he gaining so much popularity? The rising popularity began last year when he recommended stocks for free at his cafe every day to help individual investors recover their principal.Many people are curious about him, who started investing in stocks with the money of 10,000 won to buy and succeeded as a super ant, and his success story is famous enough to be reported in the majority of the media and is now a legend.In addition, he appeared on most broadcasts as a billionaire and set an example that he could succeed even at a young age, making headlines.However, his life, which had been on a roll, changed a lot as he worked as an analyst. After his success as a super ant, he was offered an analyst scout by numerous companies, and he began his career as an analyst in earnest, setting a record of being the youngest in Korea at that time.And even at the time of his activities, he was selected as the best expert in a short period of time, and he did not miss the best position anywhere. However, I felt skeptical about the life of an analyst who had to pursue the company's interests, and now I retired, saying, ""I want to do something worthwhile rather than money and honor.""At first, he helped people in need by volunteering after retirement, but when he remembered his difficult times as he saw people struggling with stocks around him, he decided to help individual investors recover their principal.In addition, while considering providing investment information to individual investors who lost money, a stock cafe was opened to allow anyone to receive investment information without burden. The reason is that they opened a stock cafe that is familiar to people so that they don't feel pressured to visit them.And the first thing that started at the same time as the opening of the cafe was to recommend real-time stocks for free every day to help individual investors choose the stocks that they have the most difficult time.Since it was a stock cafe opened without anyone knowing, the number of members was only a club, but the recommended item had a high hit rate and rumors spread that the principal was recovered only with free recommended items, and this part became an issue.Year after year, he still offers free daily recommendations for individual investors and can be found in his current cafe.Even if his efforts cannot change the stock market, his appearance in the world of materialism has shocked people and once again made them feel that money cannot fill everything.Market Analysis Research Stocks Oil and Gas Automotive Parts Innovation Far East Oil Window Oil Eye Energy Leadkop Central Energy Bis East Asia Cement Heunggu Oil Eco Ocean Metal Korea Frenzy CPI Global Peace Industry New Material Nexentech Power Company Hyundai Wai Chemicals Control Yura Hyundai Engineering Co., LtdAPSTECH OTECH Clean & Science Cheongbo Industry Nextek Geumho Tire NEXCENTE Tire Duol Industry Room GNGGNG Non-ferrous Metal General Holding Company Publishing Automobile Korea Zinc Gold STZoil Aluminum Sennit Dongkuk SPJ Metal Backlighting Hanchang Industry Shine Youngpung Metal Samuminium Holding Co., Ltd.

"There is a super ant that set a record of more than the number of attendees for the first time in the solo lecture company award last month. And now the stock market continues unflinchingly with his story and has recently gained huge popularity among people with the modifier ""God of Stocks.""The main character of the talk is Jae-sung-gun, who is called the new generation super ant and has become interested in rare Boks.Then, who is he and why is he gaining so much popularity? The time when his popularity rose from now on began to become an issue if he recommended stocks for free to his cafe every day to help individual investors recover their principal.He started investing in stocks with the money of 10,000 won and succeeded as a super ant, and his success story is well-known enough to be reported in the media and broadcast in . In addition, most of the broadcasts, including him, made headlines by showing an example that he could succeed even at a young age while appearing as a rich man.However, his life, which had been on a roll, changed a lot as he worked as an analyst. After his success as a super ant, he received an analyst offer from the company, and he began his career as an analyst in earnest, setting the record for the youngest analyst in Korea at that time.And at the time of his activities, he was selected as the best expert in a short period of time, and he did not miss the best position anywhere. However, skeptical about his career as an analyst who had to work only for the company's profits, he retired and decided to do a rewarding job to help individual investors recover their principal.The first thing he started after retiring as an analyst was to open a people-friendly stock cafe so that individual investors could freely use it. And here, for individual investors who are not good at selecting stocks, they started recommending stocks for free every day, and this part quickly became known to people.At first, it was only a small club, and the number of members was small, but as rumors spread that the recommended items were hit and the principal was recovered only with free recommendations, it has grown into a large cafe with more than tens of thousands of cafe members, and this part has been reported and aired in the media.Even now, many people wake up early in the morning to access his cafe to see free recommendations, and it is so popular that hundreds of people a day scramble to sign up. The reason why so many people visit him is that there are free recommendations, but above all, the exact timing of the sale is the biggest impact.He surprised people once again by showing his ability to accurately designate the sale price only once as a super ant when recommending stocks. Stock investors may know, but setting the exact timing of the sale is a difficult part for even a few experts.Year after year, he still offers free daily recommendations for individual investors and can be found in his current cafe...Even if his efforts cannot change the stock market, his appearance in the world of materialism has shocked people and once again made them feel that money cannot fill everything.

"After the fearful audit season, when listed companies with a market capitalization of less than 100 million won fell sharply, more listed companies fell short of the price of a luxury apartment in Gangnam, Seoul.According to Yonhap News Agency's inquiry with the Korea Exchange, the market capitalization of listed companies was found to be less than 100 million won as of the last day.Considering that the market price of Tower Palace Car Penthouse, a residential and commercial complex in Dogok-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, is worth 100 million won, it is theoretically possible to sell one apartment to acquire a listed company.Companies with market capitalization of less than 100 million won are more than 100 million won, and companies listed on the stock market are less than half the price of an apartment.The rest of the companies were confirmed to have more than 100 million won and less than 100 million won and less than 100 million won and less than 100 million won and less than 100 million won and less than 100 million won.The market capitalization was small in the order of MNC Storm, NC, NF, Kyungyoon Hydro, Central Design, Unitek Electronics, NVIXX, OraBiotics, Defashion Clasta World Tour, Han Wireless, Hallim Changtu, Point Eye, Bongsin, and Daesun Chosun.Among listed companies, except for Shinmin Savings Bank's NAMIN LSIS Ecureis Glotech, are insolvent companies designated as management items due to problems such as abnormal capital erosion rates or large losses in consecutive business years during the latest business year.Most of these listed companies saw their stock prices weaken during the audit season.

"Four Humans will participate in the government's core project to build green logistics.According to the Japanese securities industry, Foreman jointly applied for a patent on technology related to vehicle loading measuring devices with the Korea Transportation Safety Authority under the Ministry of Construction and Transportation last month.This technology is used to accurately measure the load of cargo trucks and others that generate a lot of smoke. Among the greenhouse gas reduction policies the government is preparing, it has been pointed out as a problem that it has not been able to accurately grasp the status of cargo trucks.For example, many pointed out that vehicles exceeding the loading weight have a rapid increase in smoke, and that there are not many equipment to measure it in Korea and the reliability of the inspection results is poor.An official from the securities industry said, ""The load measurement technology is one of the government's major development technologies and is related to the development of green logistics and eco-friendly cars,"" adding, ""The problem is that there is no basic survey in Korea.""He said, ""Inefficient logistics increases the cost of distribution and increases greenhouse gas emissions due to increased mileage and mileage,"" adding, ""The government is aware of this problem and is actively applying for joint patents.""The Korea Transportation Safety Authority will support the collection of basic data on vehicle distribution by companies and inspect implementation plans related to greenhouse gas reduction. In addition, the government's target management tasks such as performance evaluation are entrusted.The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs plans to come up with various support measures to ensure that companies' logistics energy target management is carried out smoothly. In particular, it plans to select projects that have a great effect on reducing greenhouse gases related to logistics and subsidize some of the project costs from next year. Through this, it plans to gradually reduce logistics greenhouse gases by year.If participating companies' gas reduction plans are carried out as scheduled next year, they are expected to cut only annually.

"Vehicle dynamometer equipment, vehicle inspection equipment.As soon as it receives environmental certification next year, 4Human, an environmental technology company, is carrying out the government's policy to reduce automobile greenhouse gas emissions.Last year, 4Human completed the factory registration of 4Human Center facilities equipped with a medium and large vehicle dynamometer system that can comprehensively measure emissions and fuel efficiency of large cars such as monthly trucks and buses at its Ansan plant in Gyeonggi Province. After receiving approval from the National Institute of Environment this month, it obtained an international certificate for comprehensive automobile testing from an international certification agency and conducted comprehensive performance tests on large cars at home and abroad.In particular, the company is carrying out government projects related to technology development for automobile environment improvement, including measures to reduce automobile emissions and technology development by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs.Currently, advanced countries such as Europe, the United States, and Japan are implementing measures to regulate fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. The Korean government also plans to implement regulations on automobile fuel efficiency, greenhouse gases, and fine dust and nitrogen oxides, which are air pollutants, in accordance with the Framework Act on Green Growth, starting next year.For Human, the nation's first mid- to large-sized dynamometer system that can comprehensively measure the performance of large and medium-sized vehicles, and the system has been designated as the world's third international certification inspection facility after the Tokyo Institute of Science and Automobile Research.SIn the existing medium and large vehicle dynamometer system, it is difficult to accurately measure the emissions of large vehicles produced and shipped with individual drive shafts because they have individual vehicle drives that give driving conditions to measure performance. On the other hand, Four Human's next power meter has a clear drive shaft. It is possible to accurately measure car power and fuel-fuel emission conditions while setting the weight of a large truck or bus on a roller to adjust the road surface conditions to the same temperature and wind and humidity pressure as the actual driving conditions. It also has a system that can be applied to performance tests and measurements of new low-pollution vehicles.Automotive performance test vs. dynamometer system configuration diagram.To this end, it has acquired type approval and quality management system of gas analyzer and large dilution tunnel power meter this year, and plans to conduct international standards for measurement and analysis next year.The government's task related to Four Human's greenhouse gas reduction policy is to calculate the greenhouse gas emission coefficient, prepare measures to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, develop technology to improve greenhouse gas, and develop methods to check and inspect emissions. Other tasks related to technology development include developing methods for evaluating fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas improvement technology, installing solar cells in large trucks for transportation, and developing aerodynamic improvement products to increase energy consumption of medium and large commercial vehicles.The company expects additional profits of about 100 million won per year in addition to basic sales due to the implementation of state-run projects and R&D services. In order to improve the air environment, the government plans to implement a pilot project to reduce emissions from construction heavy equipment such as bulldozer excavators starting next year. As a result, business demand for Four Human Automobile Centers is expected to expand further.4Human plans to finish developing a device to reduce heavy construction costs and release the product as soon as it receives environmental certification from the government next year. An official from Four Human said, ""We expect sales to more than double in the future due to the implementation of state-run projects and the release of emission reduction devices for construction heavy equipment.""The company also developed a new model for medium and large cars with smoke reduction devices embedded in mufflers and began full-scale production of its annual Ansan plant. Last month, it was approved by the Japanese government as a device to reduce subsidies for emission reduction projects and is selling them to individual models of Japanese automakers such as Nissan Diesel and Toyota Mitsubishi.

"4Human, a producer of smoke reduction devices, is showing strong expectations for market expansion.Ilpo Human is trading at the won, up from the previous day.The strong stock price is attributed to the revitalization of the smoke reduction policy pushed by local governments. Starting in the second half of this year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government will enact and implement an ordinance banning the operation of diesel cars that emit excessive emissions.The move comes after the government revised a special law on improving the air environment in the Seoul metropolitan area last month and established a basis for limiting the operation of pollution vehicles to local governments.Under the ordinance, the Seoul Metropolitan Government will ban all diesel vehicles that exceed the emission allowance standard among those that have not taken low-pollution measures other than those that are obliged to wear smoke-reducing devices.If the vehicle is caught while driving, it will first receive administrative guidance to install a reduction device within a day, and after that, it will be fined 10,000 won for each detection. Forehuman manufactures and exports diesel cars' emissions reduction devices to Japanese companies.An official from Forehuman said, ""We are exporting products that pass both screening and evaluation by Japan, which are strict in reducing emissions,"" adding, ""Now that the domestic market is also active, we plan to expand domestic consumption and exports at the same time.""

Specifically, it was found that it was 100 million won for parts development centers and equipment construction, 100 million won for developing technology, and 100 million won for developing marketing manpower. In order to build a production base, it is necessary to create a clean diesel car parts production base with annual production capacity of 10,000 units and create an eco-friendly car city linked to automobile complexes.Forehuman is producing diesel engine emission reduction devices and seems to have been highlighted by its partnership with Nissan Diesel Research Institute in Japan.

Shares related to carbon emissions, including Fusung GNTec Holdings and Hansol Home Deco, were strong side by side.

"Dawonsys' listing is expected to increase interest in nuclear fusion-related companies. Businesses are also speeding up as actual sales of companies, which were considered only possibilities, occur one by one. The activities of large companies such as Hyundai Heavy Industries are also expected to expand.According to a securities firm, Dawonsys, whose first transaction was made on the same day, is expected to generate sales related to fusion power supplies soon.Dawonsys, which was established in 2011, is one of the leading fusion parts companies and produces power supplies necessary for fusion, electromagnetic induction heating, plasma power supply, and solar power supply.The fusion power device, which accounts for sales, was selected as one of the major items procured by Korea as a component exclusively supplied to the company.Dawonsys rose to the upper limit of 10,000 won in morning trading after forming the initial price at 10,000 won, which is higher than 10,000 won. This is in contrast to the recent poor stock flow of newly listed companies.Stock industry sources are paying particular attention to the fact that actual sales related to the business occur.Hyundai Heavy Industries will also have its first related sales early next year. Hyundai Heavy Industries signed a contract with the National Institute of Fusion Research this month to make a port with the main body of the vacuum container.This is the most important procurement item for the joint development project, and the contract amount reaches 100 million won. Hyundai Heavy Industries will manufacture and supply one of the core components, the sector of the vacuum container body, the entire central port of the unit, and the entire lower port of the unit by the beginning of the year.In addition, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction is drawing attention regarding superconducting magnet structure, and Duksung is drawing attention as a developer of fusion superconducting magnets and superconducting wires.Forehuman has a plasma gliding arc discharge method of a large company, and Iljin Energy has technology to manufacture tritium storage containers. Goryeo Steel is carrying out a superconducting composite wire project through its subsidiary.It is noteworthy that nuclear fusion is more advanced clean energy than nuclear power. If nuclear power uses energy generated through a fission reaction, fusion generates energy through a fusion reaction, which is the principle that the sun emits light.Although it is difficult to create and control ultra-high-temperature plasma conditions, research by countries that pay attention to the infinite energy resources is fierce. It is pointed out that deuterium and lithium needed for nuclear fusion can be obtained sufficiently from seawater. Deuterium is close to infinity and lithium can be used for 10,000 years.In particular, nuclear fusion does not emit carbon dioxide such as fossil fuels and does not have high-level radioactive waste, which is a problem of nuclear power generation. In other words, it can be used as a power source for electric vehicles in factories that operate electricity instead of coal raw materials. The project will be carried out in the Cadarash region of France, with all countries participating. The construction cost is billions of euros, and the total project cost is billions of euros.In the annual construction stage, billions of euros will be invested, and Korea will pay in kind cash equivalent to the input cost.Korea manufactures and supplies several items through its own technology, such as basic vacuum container port for superconductor vacuum, blanket, blanket shield, assembly equipment, heat shield, tritium storage system, power supply system, and diagnostic devices.As the government plans to actively promote the excellence of Korean nuclear fusion technology at the International Conference on Fusion Energy in Daejeon on Monday, interest from investors as well as workers in related industries is bound to grow.

"Kim Jae-soo, head of the Korea Institute for Investment, emphasized the word ""study"" dozens of times in interviews with the Korea Economic Daily after starting his professional career in the closed stock information site ""Lee Je-ro"" in the year of the KOSPI's rise.I was crazy about annual stocks, so I slept only three to four hours a day and studied for months. We analyzed financial statements and annual charts of close stocks listed on the stock market and KOSDAQ market.As a result, the flow of events began to be seen. Director Kim stressed that although good analysis techniques and trading systems are emerging these days, the investment method he learned himself has a much higher success rate than using what others have developed, and that the most important investment point comes from experience.Director Kim said that keeping principles aside from studying is important as the secret to successful investment. He said, ""If you miss the timing of the sale in anticipation of a higher return when you achieve the return you set, you will lose money,"" adding, ""The way to make money is to set certain standards and sell your stocks without hesitation."" He also added that he must avoid buying stocks that he does not know well because stock prices are on the rise recently.The moment when Major General Kim felt most rewarding as a stock expert was when the domestic stock market was halved due to the annual financial crisis. When foreign selling and pension fund buying were engaged in a dispute over the KOSPI, he said in various broadcasts and lectures, ""The pension fund can support the index, but it has no power to raise it,"" stressing that once the line is broken, it should cash in its holdings to avoid risks. Eventually, the index went below the line and there were a flood of thank-you calls from people who had reduced their losses after listening to his lecture.Director Kim predicted that the KOSPI could rise to the line this year. He predicted that the double dip will not appear because governments in advanced countries such as the U.S. and Europe continue to come up with economic stimulus measures, saying that overseas unfavorable factors that are holding back the stock market are already exposed.He said, ""The KOSDAQ market, which has been heavily attended by individual investors as large-cap stocks continue this year,"" but analyzed that if the KOSPI rises to the line, small and medium-sized stocks will also receive funds and keep pace.Environmental stocks such as greenhouse gas and wind power batteries were cited as the theme of the second half of the year. This is because the issue will be highlighted at major events such as the summit of major countries in the coming month and the general meeting of the parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in the month. Analysts say that Hu Sung-Pohuman Hansol Home Deco, which is in the process of carbon emission business, will be on the rise.Wind stocks, which are representative of new and renewable energy, are also expected to regain their upward trend. Director Kim said, ""After the financial crisis, wind stocks have fallen a lot due to sluggish investment, but now they seem to have bottomed out,"" adding, ""The long-term outlook for wind stocks is bright as environmental issues become increasingly important.""Energy and Techno Semichem, which are secondary battery-related stocks, are also expected to receive a lot of attention thanks to the growth of eco-friendly industries. He also expected an additional increase in the benchmark interest rate around the month, and explained that among bank stocks, financial insurance stocks need to pay attention to Hyundai Marine & Marine Insurance.Director Kim predicted that although the yield is low due to individual investors' inability to buy chemical stocks or holding companies that have risen a lot recently because they have a lot of information technology stocks, they will recover a lot in the second half of the year. If you are losing money in your current state, it is better to wait until you make up for some losses than to sell other stocks right away.Reporter Kang Hyun-woo: ""When will apartment prices fall?

"As the domestic stock market began to take a breather due to soaring stocks related to the theme tour electric vehicle, the heat of the themes was somewhat waning as it showed no clear direction. However, the electric vehicle theme recently hit the upper limit of G&D Wintech and Motors, with tireless momentum on the news that the government is fostering the electric vehicle industry. In particular, related stocks have been on the rise day after day as news spread that electric vehicle manufacturers will be listed indirectly.Meanwhile, smartphone and nuclear power-related stocks, which have recently shown strong performance, showed differentiation by individual stocks and did not show a clear direction. Therefore, it seems desirable to take a differentiated approach to the theme as a stock that is expected to directly benefit from the theme after thoroughly checking whether the supply and demand have deviated.New York Stock Exchange closed strong on the first quadruple trading day this year due to eased uncertainties over Greece and strong banking stocks due to issues following the previous day, but weak telecommunications and consumer goods sectors. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro on improved European economic indicators, while international oil prices rose on expectations of rising global demand for crude oilOn the previous day, the local stock market struggled to continue its upward rally as foreign and institutional buying shone once again. Perhaps the market has been thoroughly cautious ahead of the recent re-emergence of concerns from Europe and the first quadruple switching day this year. Fortunately, foreigners showed a net purchase of 100 million won today and made a net purchase of more than 100 trillion won this month, showing strong bets on economic recovery.Then, from now on, let's look at the current market situation from a macro perspective and come up with a strategy for today's Quadruple Switching Day. First, let's look at the recent series of purchases by foreigners and institutions. I believe that the current domestic market situation has already been fully reflected in the market due to external unfavorable factors such as the fiscal crisis from Europe and concerns over China's austerity, encouraging investor sentiment in risky assets.If so, how to deal with this year's first Quadruple Switching Day, which will be held today, fortunately, the market shock from the expiration date of futures options is not expected to be as big as expected. The reason is that the balance of the sale difference as of the first day reached KRW trillion, which is likely to attract program purchases to liquidate it. Second, the net buying of foreigners and institutions today can also be predicted that the impact of today's option expiration date will not be significant.Therefore, since today's market is unlikely to have much volatility depending on the expiration date, it is better to narrow down the industry to telecommunications, finance, steel, metal, distribution, and chemistry, which have recently attracted buying from institutions and foreigners. In addition, it is judged that the response set as a line by raising the level of the box ticket to one level is valid.an excavation project for a program of tweezers Major Energy Hynix Neowiz Games Seoul Semiconductor Shinhwa Intertek Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Sungkwang Bend.

Fusung is also on the rise in line with the news of electric vehicle benefits, and Huchems Four Human is also starting to rise.Amid the recent growing interest in low-carbon and green growth internationally, related companies are fiercely competing to secure carbon emissions in line with the government's active moves in Korea.The government will hold a workshop on strengthening cooperation in the carbon market between developed and developing countries amid the revision of related laws. The government's move has attracted attention from large companies such as POSCO and Samsung Electronics, as well as related companies preparing for carbon emission control projects.

"Expectations for allowing a surge in tweezers-themed electric vehicles to operate downtown The local stock market recovered lightly as investor sentiment recovered after Greece succeeded in issuing billion-dollar government bonds. Most of the themes were strong. In particular, electric vehicle-related stocks rose strongly on the rebound in the market, with Samyang Optics rising to the price limit due to expectations that electric vehicles will be allowed to operate in the city soon.In addition, stem cell-related stocks continued to rise as they continued to raise their low points, with acid P&C rising on expectations of a revision of the bioethics law. Related stocks are expected to rise further as rebound buying is flowing in after sufficient adjustment. Meanwhile, nuclear-related stocks are also affected by favorable factors from Turkey, with Morgan Korea and KEPCO rising, respectively. Improved employment indicators The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on the back of improved employment indicators, marking a consecutive weekly rise. It was also a week when consumer credit rose by $100 million a month, raising expectations for a recovery in consumption. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against major currencies following reports that the Greek parliament approved the budget, while international oil prices rose on the back of improved employment indicators.As the possibility of resolving the recent Greek crisis has gradually been reflected in the stock price, the market seems to be slowly recovering based on the supply and demand of foreigners. The New York Stock Exchange, which closed last weekend, is also gradually emerging from its worst phase due to improved consumer credit and employment indicators.However, considering the recent global market situation, there is a high possibility of an exit strategy aimed at raising interest rates again in the economic recovery phase, so it is necessary to take a little more time to pay attention to the market trend early in the week to implement an active strategy. In other words, in my opinion, it is possible to roughly estimate the direction of the market at least early this week.Therefore, it is believed that the market is still an extension of the box market, and it is better to respond to the market by focusing on building short-term positions rather than mid- to long-term positions. Fortunately, foreigners are expected to improve supply and demand following the stock market's rise on Monday morning, so I carefully predict that it will be a fresh Monday market.an excavation project for a program of tweezers Major Samsung Heavy Industries, Fan Ocean, Hanjin Shipping, Hyundai Merchant Marine, Daeshin Securities, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering.

"Stock prices of companies with smoke reduction technology have been strong day after day. Expectations for the possibility of expanding the diesel vehicle low-pollution project pushed by local governments seem to have worked.As of Sunday afternoon, 4Human, who entered mass production with facilities capable of producing 10,000 exhaust gas reduction devices for automobiles per year, compared to the previous day. The market is trading at 10,000 won.Iljin Electric Co., a producer of diesel vehicle smoke reduction devices, is also recording a rise of won from the previous day.Stock prices of these companies have continued to strengthen recently. The background is the prospect that low-pollution projects, which have been promoted by local governments, will lead to results and the market for companies that reduce smoke will expand further.At the end of last year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government said the concentration of fine dust was the lowest since last year's observation. As a result, the city expanded to a city street that had only been in the past, and in particular, the clear weather continued for days when the level of fine dust pollution fell below.The Seoul Metropolitan Government assessed that the diesel vehicle low pollution project, which has been promoted so far to convert natural gas buses and attach smoke reduction devices to old diesel cars, has paid off.

"Stock prices of carbon emission-related stocks such as Hansol Home Deco and Hu Sung are fluctuating. The low-carbon green growth theme, which had been quiet since the Copenhagen theme late last year, is being talked about again for reasons of China's National People's Congress.Hansol Home Deco has been strong for three consecutive days, rising more than the beginning of its opening. Hu Jinsung, which first introduced the carbon emission business in Korea, has also been on an upward curve since last month, and Hu Jems has been on a rebound until recently, with last month at the bottom. Four-Human climbed for three consecutive days until the previous day and began to take a breather.According to Korea Securities, China is expected to emphasize overall restructuring and low-carbon growth strategies at the train's national convention.

The Chinese government aims to reduce carbon emissions year-on-year by focusing on reducing greenhouse gases by reducing energy and improving energy efficiency.

"Expectations for revitalization of the government's policy to explore the theme of tweezers The domestic stock market rose to the top as supply and demand of foreigners and institutions recovered. By jumping on this, the themes continued to be relatively solid. Among them, WiBro Theme continued to rise steadily after Choi Si-joong, chairman of the Korea Communications Commission, expressed his intention to create a fund worth 100 million won by next year. In particular, Kisan Telecom led the rise in related stocks, recording the upper limit.In addition, stem cell and healthcare-related stocks also showed a strong trend for the first time in a long time. In particular, in the stem cell theme, Cha Bio& announced that the retinal pigment epithelial cell therapy derived from embryonic stem cells, which is being developed jointly with a U.S. stem cell company, has been designated as a rare drug by the U.S. Department of Health. It showed a sharp rise. Given that recent technical adjustments have been sufficient, stem cell-related stocks seem to have enough room for further gains in the future. The New York stock market was strong with improved economic indicators early in the market, but the U.S. Fed closed lower due to economic comments and concerns over bank reforms in the beige book late in the market. On the same day, the Fed evaluated through the beige book that the economic situation in some parts of the U.S. has improved gradually, but it has dampened investor sentiment by pointing out that commercial real estate loan demand and employment are still weak. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar weakened against major currencies on the back of Greece's plan to cut further fiscal deficits, while international oil prices closed higher on the back of the weak dollar.On the previous day, the domestic stock market was a day when institutions and foreigners' buying shone as anxiety over the southern European financial crisis eased, with Greece and Portugal plunging by about. However, it is too early to discuss a full-fledged trend change, with disappointing quarterly results last year and foreigners turning to monthly for the first time in years, selling a net 100 million won last month.As discussed above, the domestic stock market is reducing its volatility by increasing resistance to domestic and foreign unfavorable factors such as exit strategies and fiscal unfavorable factors from Europe. However, I still believe that it is necessary to maintain the market from the standpoint of wait-and-see. The reason is that last year's quarterly performance is only at the level of profit expected at the end of the year. If so, it is highly likely that the annual forecast will also be lowered. Another final decision to support Greece could be a last-minute pain, and bad news from Europe will still be a burden on the market.Fortunately, as China's domestic stimulus policy begins in earnest, the proportion of exports in the domestic export sector, especially semiconductors and auto parts sectors, is continuously increasing, and if uncertainties in the market are resolved, it is highly likely to establish an outpost that can knock on the top of the box. Therefore, it is worth paying attention to how the mixed trend of the New York stock market, which closed early in the morning, will affect the supply and demand of foreigners.Major Kia Motors, Woori Financial Group, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Samsung Engineering, Energy NCsoft, etc. are discovering tweezers. Unlike other professional broadcasters, which operate on a high monthly basis, the chip system, which is affiliated with strong beekeeping, Cha Bio and Samyang Optics Seoul Semiconductor Human Woori Finance, can be used only with the industry's lowest fee and an additional order.Details of joining the tweezers system can be found on the website, and other inquiries can be found through the customer support center.

"The Ministry of Knowledge Economy announced a preliminary feasibility study on the development of parts for clean diesel cars and the development of core parts industries for early mass production. The main focus is to foster the clean diesel industry, such as fostering the green energy industry and regulating carbon dioxide emissions, which have been continuously discussed with the current government.As a result, the trend of the times has been created for 4Human, who operates exhaust gas reduction devices, to attract attention, and interest in gas removal devices for internal combustion engines, specific harmful gas treatment devices, is expected to increase.In addition, as it stands out in the field of sensitive waste treatment device solutions, it is judged that Forehuman's sales can create a more stable profit structure through the environmental industry and the industry.In particular, the company has several affiliates. Among them, F.H. decided to transfer all of the reduction device business units to its parent company, Forehuman, through a public announcement on Monday. The profits from the reduction device, which had been reflected only in equity valuation gains so far, have been reflected in direct sales since the quarter, and sales and operating profits are expected to increase significantly.The increase due to the transfer of the reduction device business is estimated to be approximately 100 million won in sales, operating profit, and net profit.In addition, in the case of exhaust gas reduction devices, profits are generated through exports to China and Japan, which is greatly affected by the exchange rate, and profitability is improving due to the recent yen appreciation.Finally, the technical analysis shows that the company's stock price trend is the beginning of a full-fledged trend, as it has been converging for a long time from the low point to the long box pattern.In conclusion, the growth of the company's clean diesel business through the trend of the times and the short-term performance improvement due to the yen's appreciation are expected to serve as momentum for the stock price to rise to 10,000 won.

"Following last year, the green wind is strong in the stock market this year. Hybrid carbon emission bike theme stocks have been fluctuating since the beginning of the year. With the government's green growth policy coupled with global climate issues, a series of large companies' rush to invest in related businesses is also adding strength to the green theme.Park Ok-hee, an analyst at Investment & Securities, said, ""In the case of Wall, the strength of theme stocks centered on favorable policies will give momentum to the upward momentum,"" adding, ""It is similar to the trend of steady popularity last year with green growth theme stocks such as hybrid cars.""Hybrid cars Currently, the theme that stands out among investments in the green industries is hybrid cars. The aftershocks of interest remain until now as hybrid cars have drawn attention at the Detroit Auto Show in the U.S. This is because Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda, including General Motors, unveiled hybrid cars at the auto show. As Volkswagen is also reportedly planning to introduce a new hybrid car, related stocks are on the rise.The so-called Samhwa Family, such as Samhwa Electronics, Samhwa Electric, and Samhwa Capacitor, which are classified as key stocks of hybrid cars in the domestic KOSDAQ market, has shown an increase in stock prices this year. Filco Electronics and Krova Hi-Tech are also stocks that hybrid car themes wear when paying the market price.Park Moo-hyun, an analyst at Yuhwa Securities, said, ""The purpose of hybrid cars is technology that can be simplified to improve fuel efficiency,"" adding, ""New devices are needed to minimize internal combustion engine power.""While the bicycle government is pushing for legislation on bicycles, electric bicycle-related stocks, which have the symbolism of eco-friendly themes, are also emerging again. NexContec, which develops electric bicycle battery packs, is showing the highest rise among related theme stocks this year, and Samchully Bicycle, which is developing electric bicycles with domestic parts, is also proving the sustainability of bicycle themes. Especially, an electric bicycle motor mass production company, is also classified as a bicycle theme stock.Park Jong-sun, Byun Joon-ho, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities Co., said in a report on the last day that this year will be a year to lay the foundation for the domestic bicycle industry, adding that the improvement of the bicycle-related legal system will be actively pursued. Analyst Park gave a positive outlook, saying, ""With the new advent of electric bicycles equipped with batteries, we are looking forward to the revival of the bicycle market."" Accordingly, it is analyzed that investors' interest will expand to various fields, including battery industries related to major parts and electric bicycles, along with existing bicycle manufacturers that reflect policy support and industrial development plans.Carbon emissions trading is expected to begin in earnest this year, and carbon emissions-related stocks are also mentioned to function as major theme stocks. It is known that carbon emission rights will be traded as early as the second half of this year after going through a pilot project from Monday. The pilot project will be carried out with the participation of factories and businesses of general companies such as Samsung Electronics and Lotte Shopping and public institutions such as Seoul City Hall, drawing attention. As it is also preparing to introduce derivatives such as emission futures trading, special attention is required to related stocks.Companies that used to run the existing carbon emission business as well as companies that produce greenhouse gas reduction devices and carbon capture facility machinery devices are classified as related theme stocks. Shares related to carbon emission rights include Forehuman Unison and Gentech Holdings.

"Stock market analyst Midas suggested the following opinions through investment strategies.The event to be unveiled today is a miracle that I can turn my life around with just 10,000 won, as I am about to dig and dig with all my might to confirm the entry of the force and reveal the special materials.As of this week, if the stock explodes, it will rise to the upper limit immediately, and it will soar throughout the month, so don't have 100 days of stocks that are about to soar, but buy this stock at the risk of your life right now.Once the surge begins, it is confident that it is an item that cannot be caught up with other players, and it will be regrettable for the rest of your life if you miss it even after reading this article, as you decided to disclose it for investors who dream of double the jackpot return in a short period of time.What's more horrifying is that the forces that are hoarding are also leading to a jackpot in every stock they touch, causing a boom in smart money, so if they want to recover their principal losses at once, they should buy it right now.Indeed, there is no time to lose, as the first material of non-ferrous and rare metal-related stocks is already being unveiled, and a big hit scenario is underway that the public cannot imagine is the only priority to hurry up and secure supplies.Although details cannot be discussed due to concerns over exposure to stocks, it is a top domestic company and a key part of automobiles, so it can form a short-term theme as well as a performance explosion.For those who have missed countless opportunities so far, or who have been looking far away, I am confident that I will provide a turning point in the drama from despair to hope, and I recommend a super-special event to calm the stock market this year.Lastly, if you want to blow away the sadness that you have never caught a surge in stocks in your life, make sure to make a winning move with this sport.The first sign of a surge in China-related stocks was caught.China's monthly manufacturing economy has reached its highest level in recent months, showing that economic growth continues despite the yuan's appreciation and real estate market regulations, and related stocks are starting to soar. In particular, the company is showing a surge above the basic level every time the Chinese story comes out, so if not today, there will be no opportunity to buy again.Second, the price explosion is just beginning, riding on copper prices.The price of non-ferrous metals is soaring in line with the growing demand for international raw materials. Copper prices are soaring, breaking the record, and even rare metals are formed, attracting all the forces in the market to the same company. It is an event that will soar beyond imagination as forces that soar thousands at a time are gathering. You must catch it.Third, you have to hold on tightly. If you sell thousands of soaring stocks after eating a little, you will be in trouble. If you make a profit and sell it, you will regret it greatly later. The events that I speak with such confidence have soared to almost thousands. This stock is also confident in the big market. It is an event that challenges a record surge and must be caught now. Again, a big surge is perfectly imminent.

"This investment strategy is a reference for investment and is a strategy for each expert in Hankyung Dotcom content provider.Stock market analyst Yasson presented the following opinion through investment strategies.At the beginning of each month, I'm recommending individual material stocks with issues, and there is a short-term surge.In particular, Samyoung Holdings was incorporated into many investors early last month to lead to a short-term surge in bio-related stocks, and Kuro Holdings, which had not received much attention even though there were materials for clinical preparations for AIDS vaccines, was widely recommended.And in less than a week after the purchase of WBTC information, which was targeted at the same time while watching the market in the month, is achieving close profits.However, if you are thinking of investing restlessly in this stock that you are recommending today, please let it go.My recommendation is a solemnly recommended stock for investors who dream of more than double the jackpot, so only investors who want to turn their lives around with one stock should buy it as soon as the quantity comes out.This is because there is not much difference between major shareholders and major shareholders in this stock at a time when large-scale material exposure is imminent, so if a stake fight occurs due to the defense of management rights, the stock price will soar.And the company's acquisition of a giant subsidiary has caused liquidity problems to turn red and hurt its stock prices, which have caused hundreds of billions of won in valuation gains on overseas markets, which will solve the liquidity problem that has caused the stock price to fall at once.In addition, the company's performance has continued to improve due to the boom in the front-line industry, and its investment in the solar industry has led to a surge in external growth and margin rates since the end of this year.In addition, the supply and demand flow also shows the lowest level since its inception, and especially the supply and demand chart shows a pattern of pressing trees on the verge of a surge that seems to cause something right away. Also, signs of mass trading collected over the years have been found everywhere, and recently big hands have been deliberately shaking stock prices to take away last-minute personal supplies, leaving the stock really short of time to buy at low prices.For investors who have missed hundreds of short-term jackpot stocks that I have poured since the beginning of this year and those who are worried about not having any stocks yet, this stock will be a big surge that cannot be caught again within the next year, and it will help them live a comfortable life.And since these certain stocks never provide long-term buying opportunities for individual investors, they will have to prepare supplies first before they fly away no matter what.

"This investment strategy is a reference for investment and is a strategy for each expert in Hankyung Dotcom content provider.Stock market analyst Special Ho-jae presented the following opinion through an investment strategy.Investors who are satisfied with short-term profits with a cap or two should just pass this article. This stock, which I strongly recommend today, is a miraculous stock that must be secured unconditionally because it is a very amazing buying spot to easily respond to small favorable factors and easily pull out the upper limit.In fact, the joy and excitement that I have felt for the first time in a long time involves a sharp rise theme and top powers, which will soar throughout the month, surpassing Chosun Sun-jae, who has soared in half a month. Therefore, if you buy now, I am sure that you will make at least twice the principal of the investment and make a lot of money to change your life, so if you are an investor desperate for a big profit and recovery, please secure as much as you can before you fly away.You have to move fast no matter what With huge forces scrambling to secure supplies amid the sudden tension that may explode, the volume of distribution is drying up, and if it can catch this stock, it will be a hit and if it can, it will have to sell all the lost stocks.The market is always hungry for new materials and themes, as soon as the company, which will be the follow-up to Chosun Sun-jae Korea Cosmetics Daily Samyoung Holdings GemVax, is released to the media, investors will have to flock enthusiastically and fly away.Based on the world's best technology, the company is already the dominant player in the domestic market, as well as the multi-trillion-dollar contracts pouring in from dozens of countries around the world, with clear reasons for a surge of at least double the current stock price.In addition, because it is heavily armed with full government support and continuous large-scale performance and the market is as large as the nuclear power plant industry, it will make a big profit to finish the stock market in a short period of time and enjoy it comfortably.What's more important is that no matter how good the company is and how good the future prospects are, the stock price is already pre-empted and loses its merit, which is still severely undervalued because very intelligent forces are deliberately managing the stock price.Therefore, I strongly recommend it again, risking my conscience and honor in my life as an expert. Investors who have missed big events such as KD, Boseong Powertech, and Seowon Daechang Samyoung Holdings, which I recommended, should never hesitate or hesitate to throw a winning move boldly with the feeling that this is the last event to be made next year.To be clear, any investor who has never caught a proper surge, earned a little bit and vomited all at once, will be able to enjoy the huge profits accumulated in the account once the market explodes as a must-have surge. Therefore, regardless of the volatility of the index, we must seize the enormous opportunity to make profits all at once this year.Despite my strong recommendation, if you have any doubts or doubts, I hope you will boldly ignore this article. Also, today's recommended stock is a stock that has been unveiled with a determination for investors who dream of double the jackpot, so if you are satisfied with the proper profits from clumsy theme stocks or individual stocks, please don't touch this stock at all In the event of a surge in operating profit of best experts' stock information on the phone, the upper limit of the afternoon session of the soaring stock market, which is about to surge, will close and a surge rally will break out.When using information, per second of the information usage fee is charged.Ehwa Electric Co., Ltd.

The heat is hot for Jang Jin-young, who picks up large-scale stocks at once and serves individual investors suffering from losses.The investment secret of Jang Jin-young, director of Korea's Warren Buffett, has been drawing more and more attention since its recommendation to individual investors of Wondae Hyundai Mipo Dockyard. This is because Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, which no one showed interest in, jumped to 10,000 won. In other words, it hit the jackpot with a single word of the market, which is different from other securities experts.In addition, Jang Jin-young is receiving strong support from individual investors who achieved significantly different profits due to undervalued stocks in the bottom line. Sanseong P&C rose more than vertically in a year, and Ewha Womans University soared more than a month ago.In the short term, stock prices can move in the opposite direction depending on supply and demand and market conditions, regardless of their original value. Eventually, however, the stock returns to its value surprisingly. If you want to turn your life around, you need to invest your life in these undervalued stocks.Jang Jin-young, who reveals his own investment secrets and stocks to individual investors who are unable to hit the jackpot in the face of institutions and foreign power, is also making efforts to advise those suffering from losses.In a situation where the investment environment is not as good as it is now, individual investors must focus on choice and concentration. This is because there are many pearl stocks buried in the soil due to supply and demand and market conditions regardless of value and performance. As the market for opportunities to make greater profits than in the past is approaching, we will have to do our best to make successful investments.Director Jang Jin-young also said, ""If anyone understands the conditions of soaring stocks, Daewoo Engineering & Construction, Chemicals, Samsung C&T, Po Human, Hyundai Information Technology, Koentec, Woojin, Daewoo Securities and Spec-on-Media, which have recently become a big issue in the market.""Director Jang Jin-young, who clearly reveals his annual stock investment know-how on the free broadcast of the Korea Securities Academy for wandering individual investors, is still serving for the day when everyone becomes a winner in the market of opportunity.

"This investment strategy is a reference for investment and is a strategy for each expert in Hankyung Dotcom content provider.Stock market analysts' secret of soaring prices presented the following opinions through investment strategies.To conclude, we have finally found stocks such as Joseon Seonjae, which flew away less than two months after being re-listed in a personnel division at Holdings last month.It's a chance of genius in your life to grab a lot of money that probably won't come back. This time, I ask you not to buy this stock and miss dozens of times the profit due to small fluctuations, and it is a stock that you have to trust me and take it to the end of the market.Remember, I strongly recommended focusing on J-Dong communication-related stocks from the end of the month, but C-Motech, Comtek System, and Soul Tech, which are mentioned as expected stocks to establish J-Dong communication companies, are drawing a surge in the short term.However, these stocks are only a follow-up to J-Dong's theme, and the stock prices of Samyoung Holdings and Jati Electronics, which I strongly recommended at the end of the month, have repeatedly emphasized that the two stocks should not falter until Daeumbong's top-selling volume bursts.Members who believed in my strategy and followed it made huge returns with each in less than two months, and mails of appreciation poured out with greater-than-expected returns.With a strong sense of duty and responsibility as an expert to discover such a big event, I will once again reveal to you the soaring stocks that will shake up the know-how and market for years only for a single day. To be clear, I don't recommend it unless it's the best sport to improve status and fortune.First of all, the company is a new policy beneficiary that has not yet been revealed among the government's policy development plans announced by the president, but the government's policy, which is a key project, will benefit only the company with unique technology in the convergence industry.In addition, the company is the only listed company in the smart revolution called Jeje, and in a huge mobile market that surpasses the Internet revolution of years ago, a surprising event is taking place in smartphones around the world.As the company's products lead the new paradigm of the smart revolution, it is growing into a blue ocean company that will dominate the market by hundreds of trillion won without competitors and will be alone, so even top securities firms are enthusiastic about it.I'm confident that this event, which has a creepy top secret material and policy issues that I can't do anything with excitement and shudder all over my body, will surpass Chosun Sun-jae, who flew in just a month and a half earlier this year as an extreme rally that will not be satisfied with the moment of exposure.We don't have much time left If it is delayed, the sale dries up, so I don't know how much I can catch, but this stock is a hit if I catch it, and if I can, I have to sell all the stocks that I lost.For months, the manipulative technological tricks of the forces have completed the process of robbing the public of supplies and are now nearing its final peak for the best market price, so there is no room for delay. If you miss this event here today, you won't be able to sleep for months.Finally, I emphasize once again, but please keep in mind that the size of wealth will vary depending on how much you buy this stock, and the only way to fix the sale with stock investment will be this stock.

"Stock market analyst Goldrich presented the following opinion through an investment strategy.Indeed, GemVax, which is making more than double profits by expressing soaring prices without stopping even at this moment, has found a miraculous stock that will blow an unprecedented explosive market price.I'm going to make sure that the big event that's going to change your life for a few days in secret In a word, the company is a soaring stock found with all of my know-how in discovering the annual stocks, and it is a nuclear bomb-like stock that will shake the market at once if unexposed materials are disclosed. Since it's a stock that can't be explained by any modifier, let's put everything aside and buy this stock first. At this moment, there's no time to hesitate or hesitate because it's a stock that can fly to the theme of Ewha Womans University.The moment's choice determines the difference in profits. As time goes by, the seeds of distribution dried up, so we can't predict how much we can secure, but this stock is a hit if we catch it, and if we can, we should sell all the stocks that lost.The company is a super-strong luxury company that has quickly eroded the Chinese market, which boasts a billion people, and has been indiscriminately sweeping cash from the Chinese market since last year. In addition, it is not only the best beneficiary of various global events held this year, but also the details of the listing of Chasdaq are exchanged, so the chase buying is a runaway countdown that will give an unthinkable price.What's more fantastic is that the stock price is barely undervalued at the beginning of the 1,000 won range, with hundreds of billions of won in sales and tens of billions of won in net profit every year, and a nuclear explosion that goes beyond imagination.Therefore, this stock does not have to wait long after buying. The supplies are already thoroughly controlled by big hands and forces who are leading smart money, and all that is left is adjusting the timing to fly along with the exposure of materials, and more powerful materials will be released this week, so please secure supplies by any means.I sincerely ask you not to make a mistake of getting scared by a small shake and missing dozens of times the profit after buying this stock, and it is a stock that you should see the end of the market that you can trust and check.I can't list much more on the paper but I can make it clear that if you buy this stock, you're already a successful investor and you can grab a lot of money.It is too urgent. Never tell anyone about it and quietly and quickly collect it. You should never take away the quantity and take away the quantity. If I don't buy stocks that will make a lot of money if I buy them, I just want to ask what stocks I should buy.Finally, I emphasize once again Please remember today's recommended stocks. And don't doubt it, just believe it and act it out. Just keep in mind that it's up to you from now on whether you're going to get dozens of times as much revenue from this stock or be satisfied with the right amount of revenue from other stocks.Paid securities information is charged per second.Mijoo Steelpo Human Omni System's Motec Hansol Home Deco Chosun Marine Samyoung Holding Sn Networks Dongyang Securities Ubicare recommended stocks may differ from related stocks with articles, so please check the recommended stocks.

"The global stock market, which closed at dawn below the Dow's personal income growth rate, saw monthly U.S. consumer spending rise month-on-month, exceeding the expected increase, but the personal income growth rate. The fact that it only increased and fell short of the market expectation has raised concerns in the stock market.In other words, the problem was that expenditure was expanding rather than the increase in income in the absence of a clear signal of economic recovery.As I mentioned in my investment strategy the previous day, I expressed that it was difficult to take the surge in the global stock market as a sign of an upward turnaround. In other words, it is unreasonable to discuss the shift to an upward trend only with Chairman Ben Bernanke's lip service without a clear government policy at a time when the trend has collapsed.Therefore, it is thought that the stabilization of the index can be expected only after a sufficient period of adjustment to verify the effectiveness of the policy for a certain period of time after the actual economic recovery policy is implemented in the future.Concerns about the stock market's magnification turned out to be a reality on MondayThis is because the global index, which closed early in the morning, plunged again as it soared last day due to sluggish economic indicators. Fortunately, while protecting the full line, the minimum room is left, but the negative view of the market is bound to grow.However, the fact that foreigners made aggressive purchases on the previous day, including the largest net purchase in about a month and a half in the futures market, is likely to show a solid trend compared to the global stock market.Due to the technological trend, it is a pity that the exchange index is once again embroiled in concerns about the global stock market ahead of a front-line recovery. Expectations are high that for the time being, the trading market is likely to have a fierce market with the front and front lines in between until the global stock market finds stability.Therefore, while still maintaining a conservative perspective, if the index plunges until the beginning of the line, the strategy of participating in low-priced purchases little by little seems not bad. However, empirically, domestic stock markets often showed a short-term rebound when the gap fell due to the plunge in the stock market, so investors who want to sell prefer a strategy to properly split and sell for the timing of the rebound rather than participate in the early sell-off.

"The exposure of stocks that have all the characteristics of soaring stocks, such as performance, growth materials, and recruitment of probationary forces, is imminent. Investors who have suffered from loss-making in principal are expected to achieve profits that exceed tens of times the principal at once by catching this stock. The Korea Securities Academy recommended the stocks and asked them to make full actual investment as the monthly stock market is expected.The Korea Securities Academy, which has been thoroughly verified for years with member account profits and stands tall in the Korean market, added that high profits can be achieved only when blue-chip stocks undervalued at the bottom are discovered and sold through specialized trading techniques. It also said that there will be no such opportunity to make up for the investment losses that have occurred so far.Looking at the stocks recommended by the Korea Securities Academy, it was found that the minimum effect could be achieved because the seeds of distribution volume are drying up and, above all, large materials that are certain to continue to be exposed to the upper limit are imminent. Furthermore, since most of them show short-term soaring patterns, it has been confirmed as a good opportunity for individual investors who are betting on certain compression items.According to the Korea Securities Academy, Shin Sung, which has soared more than a month in recent years, and Speco, which has soared close to a week, are representative short-term soaring stocks.

Jang Jin-young, director of the Korea Securities Academy, is the one who produced a special management program that operates on the nation's largest free securities-related community securities information channel. In addition, he is a secret author of the best-selling real-life Securities Academy File and Dash 3 stocks in the stock market, and has been famous for his excellent ability to analyze stocks from the beginning of his career.Director Jang Jin-young explains that he is different from fraudsters who pretend to be famous experts with the image of manipulating returns on rising stocks. In addition, Super Ant, which has been recognized as a member account revenue in our market for years, expressed confidence that the trust of individual investors will return to soaring profits reminiscent of a large market, not just a surge.The Korea Securities Academy said it would not confront government policies or follow up on rising stocks, but only offer blue-chip stocks that are desperately undervalued and are waiting for market share to be released from the bottom, and asked individual investors to look at their returns and reviews first. It reiterated its previous willingness to be recognized only through postings and profits from individual investors who have collected stocks at an optimal time and reached a new upper limit.Meanwhile, the Korea Securities Academy said that there are electronics, Samsung Coms Ato Ace Digitech, 4Human, R&L Bio, Electronics Aroma Soft, Deoksan High Metal, Son Gokong, Iriver, etc. Jang Jin-young, director of the Korea Securities Academy, said, ""We hope to check financial analysis and technology analysis regarding the stocks and catch specific timing of sales and start actual sales.""

"Meeting of the board of directors meeting.Withdrawal of the metaphor. Potatoes, too.Wireless, which also discussed the formation of new board members, is expected to withdraw its sluggish capital increase, while establishing a new direction for the company by reducing capital and forming a new management.This article was released at E-Daily Market Point at the real-time financial economy new terminal at 1 p.m. If you use E-Daily Market Point, you can preview the high-end articles.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Han Wireless decided to convene a board meeting next month to discuss the withdrawal of the paid-in capital increase, which had been sluggish. It will also deal with the issue of dismissal of directors at the shareholders' meeting to be held on Monday to confirm the reduction of capital reduction.Although Han Wireless decided to increase its shareholder allocation worth 100 million won last month, it has not been able to bear fruit due to securities reports and settlements.The capital increase of 100 million won has been withdrawn once at the end of last month, and the amount has been increased to 100 million won per month and the method has been changed to student allocation, but it is still stagnant. It has already reached its turn to receive a correction order from the Financial Supervisory Service in relation to the capital increase allocated to students.Usually, the decrease in capital is interpreted as a preliminary step in changing major shareholders or governance structures in KOSDAQ companies. This is because it has the effect of reducing capital to make it easier for new investors to enter.In particular, it is highly likely that the decision to exclude investors who have already promised to invest through the form of allocation of students after deciding to reduce capital is a new edition.In a related development, Han Wireless also decided to propose a motion for dismissal of directors at a general meeting of potato shareholders on Monday. However, there is a possibility that Han Wireless's dismissal of directors will change in the future, given that it was made in accordance with shareholder proposals.Small shareholders, including Na Kyung-mi, who owns a stake in the company, received permission from the court to convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting at the end of last month, and nominated directors and auditors to represent their interests.A company official said, ""The decision to reduce the capital increase and withdraw the paid-in capital increase will be based on the shareholders' proposal at the general shareholders' meeting,"" adding, ""Once the capital increase and the capital reduction are carried out, a new version will be created.""HanWireless planned to strengthen its server hosting business through a capital increase of 100 million won and raise about 100 million won in short-term loans and loan repayment funds. The company plans to discuss delaying debt repayment with creditors after withdrawing the paid-in capital increase.

The KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange said last month that it will decide in a few months whether to delist Handisoften delisted.Handysoft is one of the leading software companies in Korea that went public last year.

"This article was shipped to the Professional Information Service created by Money Today on Monday.Handisoft, which is on the verge of delisting due to embezzlement and breach of trust by its largest shareholder, will push for the sale. It has re-emerged in the corporate mergers and acquisitions market for the first time in years since it was sold last month.According to Japanese-related industries, Handysoft selected law firm Gwanggaeto and Hanul accounting firm as the controllers of the sale and began the sale process. From work, investment information was distributed along with the letter of intent to acquire.Preliminary due diligence will be conducted from day to day. The acceptance of the letter of intent is due by the coming date.The letter of intent to acquire shall specify the amount of acquisition and the procurement plan and conditions for payment. The due diligence and signing of the company will take place within business days from the date of notification of the selection of the preferred bidder. The target of the sale is Handisoft's stake held by Tong Yang Holdings.Earlier, Lee Sang-bok, the largest shareholder of Tongyang Holdings, embezzled KRW 100 million in disguise for acquiring a stake in a Mongolian corporation that has no investment value at a low price and then acquiring a stake with the balance of the sale of the office building. It is the size of Handysoft's equity capital.Since then, Handysoft has been included in the delisting review list, but the exchange has accepted the objection and given it a month of improvement since mid-month.The atmosphere in the market is chilly. There is a widespread view of who will be interested in companies that have already been embezzled by the largest shareholder and have only left a shell. Moreover, Handysoft has not been able to get out of its deficit for several quarters, recording an operating loss of 100 million won in the first half of this year.An official from the software industry said, ""It is too risky to take over Handysoft when it is not certain whether it will pass the delisting review after the improvement period.""An industry source pointed out, ""No matter how short time is, it is impossible to finish the due diligence within a day,"" adding, ""Dongyang Holdings seems to want to hide a lot of things."" iPhone Galaxy is a shortcut to free success investment today's recommended stock market today's securities information rising and catching characteristics 10,000 won per week Cell phone bill discount securities Tonkage event reporter Lee Sang-kyun...Real-time News Money Today, where copyright holders' money is visible, cannot be reproduced or redistributed without permission"

"Minority shareholders have taken to the forefront since the Korea Exchange's KOSDAQ market headquarters' deliberation that Handisoft, a domestic third-generation venture company, falls under the criteria for delisting on the last day.Handisoft's minority shareholders' meeting publicly posted an advertisement for the appointment of a lawyer after announcing that it was held with a stake in . for management participation. The plan calls for appointing lawyers to fight corporate hunters and lawyer Myung, a dog law firm.This goes back to last month. Since Handysoft announced last month that it has confirmed that Lee Sang-pil, the company's real owner, embezzled funds worth 100 million won.The exchange suspended Handysoft's trading until it corrected whether it was subject to a substantive review of delisting. It was then concluded that it corresponds to the criteria for delisting as it was additionally revealed that former CEO Yoon Moon-seop conspired last month.The minority shareholders' meeting says it is unfair that they are harmed by the fact that business owners embezzled.

"While Handisoft was determined to be subject to a substantial review of delisting due to embezzlement of hundreds of millions of won by real owners, it was revealed that a professional manager participated in the embezzlement.Handisoft announced that former CEO Il Yoon Moon-seop was charged with embezzlement of 100 million won. The amount of embezzlement is equivalent to the amount of equity capital.Former CEO Yoon was appointed as CEO last month and resigned at the end of this month after going through the overseas division of Seminis, a global fruit and vegetable breeding company. It was shortly after the prosecution seized the embezzlement charge and conducted a seizure search.He also induced a rebound in stock prices by presenting aggressive sales targets immediately after the prosecution's seizure and search.Handysoft is already undergoing a substantial review of delisting after it was found that a embezzlement of 100 million won was caused by an actual owner named Lee Sang-pil earlier this month. The amount of embezzlement accounts for a high proportion of equity capital, resulting in a pessimistic outlook.According to Handysoft, Yoon is suspected of conspiring with Lee for embezzlement. Handysoft is a software company that listed on the KOSDAQ market last year. However, he was reduced to the main character of the case of embezzling tens of billions of won by leading a crooked money game in partnership with the background of Tranju.Handysoft has said it plans to consult with a lawyer and take legal action according to the procedure.

"With investors shocked by the decision to delist Neo Semitech, which has a market capitalization of 100 million won, the market is now paying keen attention to the next candidate for delisting. This year alone, some KOSDAQ companies have given up their titles as listed companies, and investors who join the ranks of billion won companies are in panic.The total number of KOSDAQ companies delisted so far this year, including Neo Semitech, which has been delisted in Japan. This month, Future InfoNet and Seratech Da-hwi faced a withdrawal from the market, and a series of bypass listed companies such as Shine System REN were kicked out of the market last month.Several companies, including Handysoft, Innet, and MCTCore, are currently on the list of de-listed companies and are awaiting disposal. Most of them are companies suspected of embezzling executives.Among them, Handysoft and Innet took over from the same company's hunters and forced themselves into overseas resource development The management and financial structure has deteriorated significantly. In the process, corporate hunters embezzled large sums of money, and individual investors who jumped on the craze for resource development theme stocks suffered huge losses.Handysoft and Innet are the KOSDAQ generations that have been listed annually, respectively, and are considered Korea's leading KOSDAQ-listed companies. However, since the middle of the year, the company has suffered from a chronic deficit and suffered ups and downs such as a dispute over management rights, which was irrevocably damaged by the embezzlement scandal and faced an inevitable fate of delisting.Recently, FutureInfonet and Seratek received a notice from the Korea Exchange that the delisting was reasonable after suffering severe ups and downs on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust and false entry of securities reports.Future Infonet has long been in a battle of responsibility between company executives and former CEO over the misappropriation of funds from poor management companies after former CEO Lim Byung-dong became a major shareholder. Ceratech was also doomed to mourning after suffering from worsening financial statements and embezzlement and breach of trust by the former CEO. The company initially counted its net loss as 100 million won last year, but since then, it has been criticized by correction investors for 100 million won.Meanwhile, according to the current trend, the number of KOSDAQ-listed companies that were withdrawn this year is expected to surpass last year.

"Investors are frustrated as two of Korea's leading KOSDAQ-listed companies were found to have been fooled by the same corporate hunter named Lee Sang-pil.Handisoft, a software company, and Internet, a network integrator, announced that there was an embezzlement case of 100 million won from the actual owner, Lee Sang-pil, respectively.The largest shareholders of Handysoft and Innet are listed as Tongyang Holdings and eBay Holdings, respectively, but the prosecution found that Lee Sang-pil, the real owner, existed behind them. An industry official likened him to the king of marijuana, who is known for sucking up and running away from listed companies.Lee Sang-pil's substance has not yet been clearly revealed. He is known to have been a loan shark and has been hunting businesses with his agent. In this case, he was found to have embezzled a large amount of fake money by acquiring a stake in an overseas corporation with no investment value at a low price and then acquiring a stake with the balance of the company's sales.It also used a method of embezzling money in the form of short-term loans through subsidiaries that are only paper companies. In addition, there was a suspicion of destroying evidence with employees at the beginning of the month in preparation for the police raid.Lee did not appear publicly, but some believe he tried to mobilize relatives to take control of the company. Regarding the relationship between the management and Lee Sang-pil, Handysoft said, ""We understand that there is no relationship between CEO Lee Sang-bok and Lee Sang-pil.""Meanwhile, the incident has left Korea's leading KOSDAQ-listed companies, which were once popular, to be disgraced. Handysoft and the Internet seem to have nothing in common, but both have something in common that they actively jumped into overseas resource development after being acquired by Lee.Handisoft has attracted investors with the news that it has invested in Mongolia's copper mine, and Innet has also led the rally in resource development theme stocks by touching on Indonesian resource development projects. In the end, investors seem to be greatly disappointed as they came to the conclusion that such a move was not a diversification of business for growth, but only a floating stock price.Handysoft and Innet are the KOSDAQ generations that have been listed annually, respectively, and are considered Korea's leading KOSDAQ-listed companies.

Trading volume recorded Manchuria, nearly double the level of the previous day.Handysoft's strong performance on the day is attributed to the news that the company's CEO has been changed from Yoon Moon-seop to Lee Sang-bok. In fact, Handysoft started with a stock price similar to the previous trading day, but its stock price rose vertically from the morning when the related disclosure was made. At one point in the market, it rose to . but returned some of the gains as profit-taking sales poured out at the end of the market.Investors seem to have especially noted that Lee Sang-bok, the new CEO of Handisoft, is a former group leader of Samsung Electronics' marketing office. Handysoft's stock price has been weakened due to rumors of embezzlement, including the recent seizure and search by the prosecution. Stock prices range from the past when the disclosure of inquiries related to embezzlement was required to the previous trading day.However, with the new CEO of a large company, some stock-related bulletin boards are showing a lot of investors who are expecting that if the company is at its worst, a person from a large company like Samsung Electronics will not be able to become CEO.Experts advised that it is dangerous to invest only with premature expectations as the CEO has been changed to a former member of a large company, but his management ability has not yet been proven.Reporter Yoon Kyung-hwan...

Since then, former CEO Han Hoon has tried to conduct a thorough due diligence on Pewbit to take over the company's management rights and stocks under the contract, but due to differences between them, the due diligence has been delayed day by day and has yet to pay the acquisition price.At the end of last month, it was reported that Pewbit took all the company's equipment, including computers, and even had a physical fight with histem researchers. In response, CEO Yoon Jae-hwa took measures to cancel the insurance policy, which is actually a dismissal disposition, and the researchers who protested filed a complaint with the Seoul Regional Labor Office over unfair dismissal, further intensifying the conflict between the two sides.As the management dispute has been prolonged, the participation in the core material project organized by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy has also turned on a red light.

"Histem, which has received attention from investors regarding cord blood and stem cell research in the KOSDAQ market, has recently plunged.It has been on a steady decline since the beginning of last month.The work ended abruptly, falling to the lower limit. The closing price is one won. Stock prices were also weak Sunday morning.The reason for the plunge in stock prices was decided and implemented recently, but the general public offering paid-in capital increase failed. Histostem conducted a paid-in capital increase for a small general public offering worth 100 million won, but it was not issued due to unsubscribed in full.Although funds were needed, even a small amount of paid-in capital increase was carried out due to lack of internal funds, but concerns that the financial situation would be difficult internally turned to dumping.Some investors say how difficult it is to announce the plan to raise capital again by Histem, which had already raised funds by issuing convertible bonds worth KRW 100 million last month.In addition, at the time of announcing the capital increase, the issuance price of new shares was an attractive discount for existing investors, but investment incentives disappeared due to the recent plunge in stock prices.In addition, histstem, which told analysts at securities firms last month that there was no paid-in capital increase for the time being, conducted a bequest after a month, raising doubts that there may be a problem inside the company.Histstem, which was traded for the first time through KOSDAQ-listed company Pewbit, has been struggling to raise its stock price by introducing various favorable factors to the market since then, but has fallen from its high point and haste.Histem, meanwhile, said in its balance sheet that as of last month, it had billions of won in both cash and cashable assets. At the end of last year, Histem said they all had 10,000 won in cash.Since the bequest failed, the financial situation will not improve, so additional bequest plans may come out in the future.

Then, the company is required to submit an audit report to the exchange on the day it received the report.An official of the Korea Exchange said, ""Under the disclosure system, listed corporations are not obliged to submit reports before the shareholders' meeting,"" adding, ""However, if an accounting firm completes the audit, it usually ends before the shareholders' meeting.""He then said, ""If the audit of the accounting firm has been delayed and the corporation has not received the report, it may not be made public,"" adding, ""There are cases where the audit report has not yet been received from external auditors.""However, if the report is not disclosed even after receiving it from an external auditor, the problem will change.

"The deadline for submitting audit reports by listed companies has already expired due to failure to submit audit reports, but individual companies have failed to submit audit reports, raising the possibility of expulsion this year. In particular, investors' concerns are growing as individual companies have already received a rejection of audit opinions corresponding to reasons for delisting.According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, individual companies failed to submit audit reports on the KOSDAQ market in the individual corporate securities market. Individual companies except Histostem PLS, Dasan REITs, and Cellon, which had to submit audit reports by day, can submit audit reports by Sunday morning, and if it passes this time, they will be designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations. An official of the Korea Exchange said, ""Accounting firms may have given the report late due to the rush of accounting firms at the end of the month, but in most cases, they often argue over bad results such as rejection of opinions.""The disclosure of the audit report is a task to inform shareholders of the audit results received from external accounting firms ahead of the general shareholders' meeting. If the company does not even submit a business report confirmed based on an audit report after a general shareholders' meeting, it will be designated as a management item and then go into the delisting process after a grace period.In fact, the listed corporation that failed to meet the deadline for submitting the audit report last year was the opening of the KOSDAQ market, of which the opening was delisted from the KOSDAQ market. The opening was also withdrawn from the securities market.There are already more listed companies that submitted audit reports but rejected opinions equivalent to reasons for delisting. In the KOSDAQ market, it is Artis' change in the securities market, including Cheil Entrepreneurship Investment, which reversed the disclosure related to audit opinions, and 7-COSP Storm & F Central Design True Hour Science Nexus Investment Maxbro Unitech Electronics and G&R Newzen IC City. Refusal of opinion comes when the scope of audit is limited for accounting books made by companies or when an accounting firm cannot determine whether they are true due to problems with the internal system. These companies were suspended at the same time as they refused their opinions, and if there is no objection after a one-day grace period, they will begin the delisting process. In addition, stocks that are subject to substantial delisting due to embezzlement and breach of trust by major shareholders can be delisted, which is highly likely to lead to a real exit crisis.On the same day, companies that have passed the deadline for submitting audit reports, such as Clasta Eco Solution, Forehuman Geno System, PLA Histem World Tour Ubitron, closed at the lower limit. An official from the securities industry said, ""With the strengthening of accounting audits and delisting review since last year, marginal companies have no place to hide,"" adding, ""It is better to invest with interest in corporate financial statements.""a journalist named Heim-sook The Dong-A Ilbo said, ""I'm a singer who abused my children by calling them radioactive material detection mothers in tap water in Tokyo, and I'm still embarrassed by replacement singers.

"A number of KOSDAQ companies have failed to submit reports even after the deadline for submitting audit reports for their companies, including histostem PLC, based on the general shareholders' meeting.In the case of last year, it is pointed out that investors' attention is required as there are cases where the company was delisted among the companies that failed to submit audit reports on time on the KOSDAQ market.According to the KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange in Japan, the company that failed to submit an audit report as of the morning of the day is Histostem PLSGino System Forehuman Eco Solution World Tour Clasta Ubitron D-Fashion.Usually, an audit report is required to be submitted before the general shareholders' meeting, but the individual company scheduled for the general shareholders' meeting failed to disclose the submission of the audit report until the day.Accounting firms in charge of external audits are required to submit audit reports on companies subject to audit before the shareholders' meeting under the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies. Then, the company must submit the report to the exchange on the day it received the audit report.An official of the Korea Exchange explained, ""Under the disclosure system, listed corporations are not obligated to submit audit reports before the shareholders' meeting,"" but that if an accounting corporation completes the audit, the audited corporation usually has to submit audit reports on the same day.""""If the audit of the accounting firm is delayed and the audited corporation has not received an audit report, it may not be possible to disclose the submission of the audit report,"" he said, adding that the above companies have not yet received an audit report from an external auditor.If the audit report is not disclosed even after receiving it from an external auditor, it is first designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation. If the audit report is not submitted after that, additional measures such as a request for inquiry disclosure will be taken because there is a high possibility that there will be a problem with the audit opinion.An official from the securities industry said, ""The submission of audit reports may be delayed due to delays in submitting related documents.""

"As the deadline for submitting audit reports by journalists Lee Joon-seo has already expired, fears of the exit of listed companies are expected to become a reality soon.Listed companies must submit reports no later than the day before the general shareholders' meeting. The move is aimed at allowing shareholders to review at least daily contents ahead of the shareholders' meeting.The monthly settlement corporation must hold a shareholders' meeting by the end of the month. Therefore, the report must be submitted no later than the day.Late submission does not mean immediate exit, but it is highly likely that companies that failed to submit reports in time will have problems. Investors need to pay special attention in that many of these companies have been delisted.According to the Korea Exchange, which abolished the listing of late submissions, all listed corporations failed to meet the deadline for submission in the audit report season last year, including the opening of the securities market and the opening of the KOSDAQ market.On the KOSDAQ market, among the new companies, the new companies were delisted. The company hurriedly posted a report the next day, but the surviving company stopped there. Neosemitech, which caused huge losses to individual investors, also announced that it received a rejection of its audit opinion a day after the deadline.In the securities market, a majority of new companies were also removed.Overall, the company was kicked out of the stock market. Although the submission of the report may be delayed due to unavoidable reasons such as delays in accounting work, companies that have not submitted the report are subject to caution.At that time, most of the companies that submitted late maintained their qualifications as listed companies were subject to indirect listing or designated as management items.Only managed stocks reached changes such as Ains Hermes Holdings Cellon in Nice Metal Micro-Robot NewGen City Histostem Securities on the KOSDAQ.An official of the Korea Exchange said, ""The submission of the report may be delayed due to the rush of accounting firms at the end of the month, but we need to pay attention to listed companies that are delayed.""The Histostempiel AGino System for Human Eco Solution World Tour Clasta Ubitron D-Fashion, which will hold a shareholders' meeting this coming day, has passed the deadline for submission respectively.Refusal of opinion is already divided into appropriate government-appropriate rejection of opinions by evaluating whether the company's financial statements are properly prepared according to accounting standards. Negligence and refusal of opinion correspond to reasons for delisting.In particular, refusal of opinion is the worst situation in which an accounting firm rejects an audit opinion due to restrictions on the scope of the audit or uncertainty over the existence of continuing companies. The securities industry explains that listed companies can file an objection, but there are few cases of relief, which actually leads to withdrawal.During the audit season, listed companies that have been notified of their rejection of opinions will make changes, including the opening of KOSDAQ and the opening of securities.Cheil Chang-tu is causing another stir as it is alleged that the company exerted pressure on the audit opinion of the accounting firm while the audit opinion was reversed from the proper to the rejection of the opinion.Hermes Holdings received a limited audit opinion.As the deadline for submitting the report expires, the number of inappropriate listed companies is expected to increase significantly. Inappropriate opinion means a limited or inappropriate refusal of opinion.Regardless of the audit opinion, a number of listed companies are also raising concerns about delisting.The construction of Bongsin and Cellon Daesun Chosun Holy Land, Hallym Changto Youbitron Gyeongyun Hydro, has been designated as a management item due to capital erosion.If stocks that are subject to substantial delisting due to embezzlement and breach of trust are added to this, last year's withdrawal chaos could arise again...New Era of News Yonhap News Mobile Application Photo Magazine Copyright Association News.

"Gloworks soared to the upper limit on the prospect that international gold prices will hit an all-time high next year following this year. However, due to the nature of the resource development project, it seems that the investment should be decided in mind that results cannot be achieved in a short period of time. In particular, in the case of Gloworks, careful judgment is required as it has been designated as a management item due to higher capital erosion rates and less than KRW 100 million in sales.Compared to the previous day, Il Glowworks. We closed the deal on the right.As major foreign media reported that experts in related industries, including analysts and traders, predicted that gold prices could rise to dollars per ounce next year, Glowork's stock price, which is pushing for gold mine development projects, also surged.Gloworks has been cited as gold-related stocks since it was highlighted that it owns a stake in Land Mongolia, which owns the gold mine Bohat mine in Mongolia.Gloworks plans to secure additional reserves by continuing its exploration activities while generating profits starting with mining of gold mines from next year.As gold mines are secured, the sentiment that the value of reserves can be expected to rise due to rising international gold prices can be seen as a catalyst for the rise in stock prices.However, stock market experts explained that it is also necessary to pay attention to the fact that Glowork's operating loss, which was only 100 million won in sales last business year, amounted to 100 million won.Many investors rush to buy gold-related stocks in anticipation of a surge in buying into companies that are carrying out related businesses, but they need to decide whether to invest in the longer term.According to the KOSDAQ market listing regulations, if sales are less than KRW 100 million for a consecutive year, it can be delisted.An analyst at a foreign securities firm said, ""If it goes according to the company's plan, additional sales could come out of the resource development business,"" but explained, ""We cannot rule out the possibility of a delay in sales due to the nature of the resource development business.""

"Stocks cheaper than the price of gum were scattered on the KOSDAQ market.Corporate stock prices among companies listed on the KOSDAQ market were found to be cheaper than the price of gum.This is partly due to the KOSDAQ market's sharp adjustment in the wake of the recent earthquake in Japan, but it is attributed to a combination of reluctance to invest in low-priced stocks ahead of the monthly audit report season.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, a total of the companies listed on the KOSDAQ market are listed with stock prices below the won. Among KOSDAQ-listed companies, stock prices are lower than gum prices.Even in the KOSPI market, which is considered a relatively superior stock than the KOSDAQ market, stocks whose stock prices fall below the won are changed.Listed companies with stock prices below KRW in the KOSDAQ market are individual companies such as AproTech Nexus Investment, Seven Cospe Gloworks, Hallim Changtu, and World Tour. In particular, in the case of Hallim Changtu and the world tour, the market capitalization is only 100 million won.In addition, companies with less than won reach the opening of the KOSDAQ market and the opening of the KOSPI market.The reason why ultra-low-priced stocks, which are lower than gum prices, are increasing is because marginal companies that cannot generate cash through business activities are increasing rapidly. On top of that, there has been a recent avoidance of low-priced stocks, and investors are not buying them.Stock market experts point out that they should be careful as they can be ruined by delisting or designating management items after buying them just because stock prices are cheap.In particular, as financial authorities are using market policies to strengthen the exit of insolvent companies to increase the soundness of the KOSDAQ market, investment in marginal companies should be made after final confirmation such as audit reports.An official from a securities firm Smallcap advised that ultra-low-priced stocks often jump on the market atmosphere rather than rise due to improved corporate fundamentals, adding that they should have a habit of improving performance and investing in companies with good corporate fundamentals.Reporter Kang Jaewoong, today's hot news is McDonald's Bulgogi Burger's pear...

"Reporter Shin Chang-yong's domestic stock market next week is still in a difficult situation to expect a continuous rise as factors that can stimulate investors' anxiety about Japan's nuclear power plant remain.In addition, uncertainties in the Middle East are gradually spreading. If the Middle East situation is prolonged, international oil prices may not be easily stabilized even in the event of a major earthquake in Japan.Japan`s stock market experts said they cannot rule out the possibility that the local stock market will undergo a temporary correction next week due to the emergence of factors that delay the recovery.The U.S. New York stock market rose as major countries agreed to cooperate to prevent the yen from rising, with the U.N. Security Council's resolution to approve military intervention in Libya and the Libyan government's ceasefire.On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average was higher than the previous day.The market closed higher by .The Standard & Poor's Index.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose points to .It rose points to .The KOSPI rose more than weekly this week in the securities market, the only major Asian country to rise last week.The KOSPI closed at . compared to last weekend.It's up by points.Japan's massive earthquake and tsunami over the weekend started lower early in the week, but rebounded amid expectations that the domestic industry would benefit from the reflection.However, as the Japanese stock market plunged more than once due to the news of Japan's nuclear explosion, the KOSPI also deviated from the line and fell to .The KOSPI, which has continued to continue its volatile trend since then, regained some stability in the second half of the week on the news that power and cooling water began to be supplied to Japanese nuclear power plants.This week, foreigners had a buying advantage of around 100 million won, while institutions bought a net 100 billion won, mainly from investment trusts. Individuals sold a net 100 billion won.Chemicals, steel, electricity, electronics, and transportation equipment sectors were strong, while distribution, electricity, gas, and transportation warehouse insurance sectors were weak.Experts pointed out that the aspect of paying attention to variables outside the market will not change much next week.Although power and cooling water have been supplied to the Japanese nuclear power plant, it is somewhat uncertain whether the worst situation has passed, and the situation in the Middle East seems to be further twisted.Lee Seung-woo, a researcher at Daewoo Securities, said, ""It seems better to assume the degree of fluctuation rather than a continuous or steep rise. Volatility is expected to be slightly lower than last week's extreme levels, it said.He added that a strategy that approaches from a buying perspective when adjusting and lowers the buying intensity inside and outside the ship seems desirable.Min Sang-il, a researcher at E-Trade Securities, said, ""The active response to the point after the point seems hasty. In fact, the points were not easy to overcome even before the big earthquake. The positive news is not clear, except that a week has passed since the earthquake and the stock market has rebounded amid foreign and institutional buying over the past three days.""Unlike the KOSPI's resilient resilience, the KOSDAQ index of the KOSDAQ market clearly reveals a weak foundation compared to the previous week.The week ended with points down.Earthquake-themed stocks, which continued to soar after Japan's major earthquake, also plunged in the second half of the week, lowering the KOSDAQ index together.Experts predicted that although there may be a technical rebound due to a short-term fall in the KOSDAQ index, it will take some time to shift to a full-fledged upward trend. For the time being, it is widely expected that there will be a limited movement around the line.Kim Jung-hwan, a researcher at Daewoo Securities, said, ""Considering issues affecting the global economic recovery, such as the Middle East crisis, global inflation, and Japan's major earthquake, it seems desirable to respond with industrial goods and materials rather than economic sentiment.""He continued, ""Although it is limited, circular sales are expected mainly in some theme stocks. For example, Aegang Remetec, Gloworks, Hansung Elcomtech, etc. related to rising gold prices could be strong due to increased preference for safe assets, and Agabang Company, Boryeong Median, etc. are expected to show a short-term rise due to the government's expectations for low birth rate.New Era of News Yonhap News Mobile Application Photo Magazine Copyright Association News.

"Last week, volatility expanded in the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan, but rose slightly, recovering the daily moving average and the daily moving average.However, it is highly likely that the KOSPI will not flow smoothly this week. Although the KOSPI index has risen, the inherent volatility of put options has increased significantly, while the inherent volatility of call options has fallen, which is expected to require efforts to manage risks.Last week, the KOSPI index. The rise confirmed resistance to radiation shocks from Japan. However, this week is not expected to deviate much from the situation affected by variables outside the market.This is because Japan's nuclear power situation is a point to keep an eye on, and it is still difficult to determine whether it is the worst.Lee Seung-woo, a researcher at Daewoo Securities, said, ""It seems better to assume a fluctuating flow than a continuous or steep rise,"" and suggested that a strategy to approach it from a buying perspective and lower buying intensity inside and outside the ship is desirable.In addition, as the situation in the Middle East is further twisted, international oil prices may wriggle again due to the possibility of a prolonged situation. Although the international community has set up a no-fly zone in Libya, civil war is only getting twisted, and sectarian wars are even emerging in Bahrain and other countries.By industry, institutions are expected to buy circularly, mainly in the chemical, steel, electric, electronic, and transportation equipment sectors, which were strong last week.This week, with no schedule for domestic and foreign economic indicators, the Japan-Europe Meeting of Finance Ministers and Chairman Il Bernanke's speech are noteworthy events.The KOSDAQ market fell sharply last week due to Japan's major earthquake, collapsing the line. Although it failed to advance, it rebounded with positive news such as the partial resumption of power supply to Japanese nuclear power plants in the second half of the week and analysis that reflective profits of the domestic industry are expected.By supply and demand, individuals and foreigners supported the index with net buying for a week, but institutions had a selling advantage of more than 100 million won, acting as a burden. In the midst of this, it is necessary to pay attention to variables outside the market, such as issues affecting the global economic recovery, such as the Middle East crisis, global inflation, and the Great Earthquake in Japan.Park Yang-joo, a researcher at Daishin Securities, said, ""If the earthquake in Japan is an important variable, it is likely that stock prices will recover mainly information technology equipment stocks, which have fallen sharply.""Kim Jung-hwan, a researcher at Daewoo Securities, said, ""We need to pay attention to stocks that are classified as low birth rates, such as Aegang Rimetek, Gloworks, Hansung Elcomtech, and Agabang Company, which are expected to raise low birth rates due to the government's expectations.""Bond interest rates have plunged in the short term as news of the explosion of nuclear power plants has been reported since the Great Earthquake in Japan, but they are expected to gradually stabilize. Volatility expanded as interest rates on treasury bonds fell sharply last week, falling below .Bond experts believe that Japan's earthquake has made it into an overheating zone due to preference for safe assets amid a strong trend since the Bank of Korea raised its key interest rate to .In addition to Japan, external conditions such as intensifying the Middle East situation will serve as factors that stimulate preference for safe assets, but risk management is expected to be more important.Park Yu-na, a researcher at Dongbu Securities, said, ""The bond market has recently been linked to the stock market,"" adding, ""It will not be easy to expect an additional drop in interest rates as bond rates have reached burdensome levels.""Lee Jung-beom, a researcher at Korea Investment & Securities, said the box-office trend will unfold in the short term. It is not easy to further fall in interest rates as interest rates on annual treasury bonds have fallen to the level at the end of last year before raising the key interest rate twice this year. Researcher Lee said, ""However, it is not easy for bond rates to rise due to weak investor sentiment due to the Japanese crisis,"" adding that short-term products will be relatively better than medium- and long-term products due to good supply and demand from foreign investors.Choi Young-hee, Kim Hak-jae, and Kim Ho-yeon.

"Gloworks stock price went back and forth between cold and hot water because of CEO Park Sung-hoon's name. Stock prices plunged due to the same name arrested by the prosecution for embezzlement and breach of trust, but it is understood that it is a process of finding its place after the misunderstanding was resolved.Il Gloworks closed at the upper limit. It has soared for the second consecutive day since the previous day.According to Gloworks, there is no good news to be announced anytime soon. If the information is exposed in advance, the stock price may soar abnormally before public announcement or media coverage, but Gloworks explains that this is not applicable.However, it can only be inferred as one of the effects of the happening caused by Park's name. It is true that there was a misunderstanding in some parts of the market as CEO of Gloworks Park over the name until Actuo Park Sung-hoon was arrested for embezzlement and breach of trust.For this reason, articles such as Park's prosecution investigation were posted on shareholders' bulletin boards and are believed to have been the main cause of the drop in Glowork's stock price. In other words, the stock price, which has soared for two consecutive days, explains the reason for the recent drop in Gloworks stock price.In the process of a sharp drop in stock prices due to rumors, Gloworks was struggling without finding a way to respond. This is because it is impossible to explain to shareholders that Park and the person with the same name are subject to the prosecution's investigation.Earlier, even in the inquiry disclosure asking the reason for the stock price plunge on the exchange last month, he could only explain to the extent that there was no reason without finding a way to explain it.An official from Gloworks said, ""We have significantly reduced our net loss from 100 million won to 100 million won last year, and we expect to see better performance as Kazakhstan's housing and Mongolian gold mining projects are going smoothly this year.""Actuo former CEO Park Sung-hoon arrested on charges of embezzlement.

"It was belatedly revealed that the largest shareholder of a KOSDAQ-listed company sold abnormal shares without disclosing changes in shares. In addition, the listed company is expected to have been more damaged by investors as it was designated as a management item due to worsening financial status after the largest shareholder sold its stake in bulk.In a monthly business report last year, Glowworks, a resource developer, said its stake in CEO Park Sung-hoon and related parties, the largest shareholder, fell from . to . In other words, the largest shareholder disposed of his or her holdings between the month and the month when the quarterly report was released.However, Gloworks did not disclose any changes in its stake. In other words, CEO Park has not fulfilled the rules stipulated in the Capital Markets Act. According to the Capital Markets Act, a person who owns more than a stake in a listed company must report this fact within days if there is a change in the stake, and in violation, he or she can be sentenced to up to years in prison or fined up to 100 million won. This is to prevent insider trading and provide fair investment judgment data to investors.Glowork's case shows why the rules should be followed. Gloworks' performance deteriorated sharply due to the bankruptcy of the company it invested in last quarter, and the capital erosion rate soared. Finally, it was designated as a managed item last month, and the stock price plunged day after day.The CEO disposed of his stake more than before its performance deteriorated sharply, but investors were not aware of it until last month when it was revealed that the largest shareholder's stake was disposed of. Shares of Gloworks hit an annual low of Won on the same day.Recently, CEO Park disposed of all remaining shares of 10,000 shares, but the process was also not transparent. Gloworks said in a public announcement on the last day that its largest shareholder has changed from Park's foreigners to Credit Industrial, and that it will disclose the date and time of the change later as soon as it is confirmed. It is explained that it was only through the list of shareholders as of last month that CEO Park stepped down as the largest shareholder.According to the Korea Exchange Securities Market listing regulations, if the number of shares owned by the largest shareholder changes even if it is a shareholder, the listed corporation must immediately report this matter. Japanese shares plunged further on the news of the sale of their largest shareholder's stake, which cannot be confirmed at any time. An official of the exchange said, ""Even the largest shareholder with a stake in . . is obliged to inform the change of the stake if the largest shareholder is the CEO,"" adding, ""We will find out the facts and impose reasonable sanctions if there is a problem.""Meanwhile, the Financial Supervisory Service says it cannot confirm Park's illegality. Ha Kyung-ho, head of the Financial Supervisory Service's equity disclosure team, said, ""We cannot give you an answer until we know whether it is illegal or not,"" adding, ""We cannot tell you whether it is under investigation.""When asked how to identify the omission of the disclosure of shares, Ha replied, ""We can't uniformly identify it with a machine, but we have to go through the verification process one by one. In other words, similar cases to Gloworks can be repeated. Special stock broadcasting by expert technicians, real-time disclosure of trade details, high-yield trade secrets, Jung Jae-woo's eyes on the world of Chang Economy, no distribution of unauthorized transactions, Gloworks, management, and sales loss increased.Gloworks to dispose of its billion-won stake in Neowizbugs for the second day"
"Changes in the largest shareholders of monthly settlement corporations are increasing significantly in the month. In the process of preparing for the regular shareholders' meeting, many companies find that the largest shareholder has disappeared and rush to make public announcements, and in some cases, they rush to raise capital to prevent capital erosion.Regardless of the reason, investors should be careful as the change in the largest shareholder at the time of settlement is a red light on the company's status.According to the Financial Supervisory Service's electronic disclosure system, KOSDAQ-listed companies whose largest shareholders have changed this year are located. Except for SPAC, the largest shareholder of companies that already have individual companies has changed in the month following individual companies in the month.The problem is that many companies do not even know that their largest shareholders have changed. It has been confirmed that the largest shareholders have changed only after receiving the list of shareholders for the settlement of accounts.G&R also announced the change of its largest shareholder through a Japanese disclosure. After the closure of the shareholder list, it was revealed that the shares held by the largest shareholders and others as collateral were sold.The company said the date of disposal of the collateral stock was not confirmed. In addition, it was not even able to confirm whether there was the largest shareholder after the change. In other words, after the change in when the former largest shareholder disposed of the shares, the largest shareholder does not even know how many shares are currently held.Gloworks also announced in a public announcement on the last day that its largest shareholder, CEO Park Sung-hoon, has changed from a foreigner to Credit Industrial. It is explained that it was only through the list of shareholders as of last month that CEO Park stepped down as the largest shareholder. The company belatedly found out that the company's CEO sold its shares and announced it.Gloworks disposed of its holdings more than the largest shareholder between the month of its quarterly report and the month of its monthly business report last year, but it also did not disclose the transfer in time.Nexus Investment also closed its shareholder list for the general shareholders' meeting, revealing the sale of shares of VCC I & Partners, the largest shareholder.In addition, it is also common in the industry that many companies, whose largest shareholders suddenly changed ahead of the settlement, rush to raise capital or sell their management rights at all to make up for capital erosion before the settlement.There are also unusual cases. Handisoft's largest shareholder has changed again as the stock transfer contract has been terminated since the KOSDAQ market was decided to exit.An official of the exchange said, ""If a general investor, not an insider, bought shares through the market and the company belatedly recognized the change in the largest shareholder, it can be taken into account.""

"Investors are required to pay attention as there is an abnormal surge in the KOSDAQ market at the end of the year after the surge in Gloworks, which promotes gold mine development. When good news comes out, stock prices soar due to buying, but when big hands such as institutions realize profits, they seem to fall sharply. It is pointed out that the government should refrain from buying chase due to one-off favorable factors as the favorable factors that have raised stock prices are unclear and performance is sometimes poor.A case in point is Gloworks, which soared last month due to news of the development of a gold mine in Mongolia, a rollercoaster ride on the news. When it was announced last month that Glowork's Mongolian subsidiary had completed various procedures for gold mine production, the stock price, which was the previous day, rose to around last month. Excluding last month's fall, the upper limit rose seven times.However, as institutions and foreigners began to realize profits, stock prices began to plunge immediately. Foreigners sold a net 10,000 shares last month, while institutions sold 10,000 shares on the first 10,000 days of last month, when stock prices peaked. As a result, the stock price fell in four days and sank to the last level. In the process, individuals' single-handed sales were rampant.In one day, billions of shares were traded, more than the total number of shares of Gloworks.The same is true of Wireless, which has been designated as a management item beyond the capital erosion rate. The stock price, which was won last month, began to soar the next day and soared to won last month. The reason for the surge is that the government decided to withdraw the reduction plan and increase the capital by paid, but the stock price has risen since last month when the related disclosure was made.It fell for five days from last month to the past when sales poured out.InterM's stock price soared even though there were no favorable factors. Stock prices rose last month after reports that Electron Bio, which InterM owns, was participating in Samsung Electronics' new bio-related business. The news was exactly the same as in the year. However, InterM shares rose vertically for four days from last month and then fell for two days from Sunday.A company official said, ""The stock price has risen abnormally due to nothing new, and given that only individual investors, not institutions, participated in the buying trend, I suspect that the operational forces came in.""As for the follow-up purchase, gold experts agreed that stocks with soaring stock prices due to one-off favorable factors that are not directly related to performance need to be careful.An analyst in charge of small caps at a securities firm said, ""Although some companies' stock prices have soared due to favorable factors such as gold mines and Samsung Electronics, it is unclear whether they can actually lead to corporate performance.""Another official said, ""Glowworks, whose quarterly operating profit fell year-on-year, and other low-priced stocks often soar due to a single positive result,"" adding, ""We should be careful as individuals can lose a lot if they rush to buy.""an old reporterSuccessful Habits Prohibiting Unauthorized Reproduction and Redistribution of Korean Economic Newspapers Copyright in accordance with the Korea Online Newspaper Association's Digital News Usage Rules"
"Stock investors' interest in gold-related companies is increasing. This is due to expectations that gold prices will soar this year and stock prices of companies doing gold-related businesses will also rise significantly.According to a securities firm's survey, gold this year recorded the highest return among various financial instruments, ranking it as the best investment product. However, no matter how promising a gold-related company is, it should be kept in mind that gold accounts for a part of the business.This means that it is unreasonable to invest recklessly in gold-related stocks. Investment that is faithful to the basics is required, considering the soundness of the company itself, not only thinking about rising gold prices.This year's yield and gold prices are rising steeply. Last week, the international gold price hit an all-time high of .dollars per ounce. On the same day, domestic gold prices also soared to 10,000 won due to retail prices. As expected, it's the best price.As gold prices soar, investment technology products, which are raising the highest return, are definitely gold. Daishin Securities surveyed the return on major financial technology products such as gold, stocks, real estate bonds, and regular deposits, and the return on gold investment recorded .The domestic wholesale price of the gold, which is the base date of the survey, is. It was full by the standard. The figure is a whopping 10,000 won increase from last year's 10,000 won.As for products other than gold, domestic stock funds, an indirect investment product, ranked first with an average return. Listed index funds linked to direct investment followed with . The yield on the Korea Bond Index was .On the other hand, time deposits and real estate only recorded representative returns. Considering the inflation rate, it is analyzed that it is a negative return. The won-dollar foreign exchange investment also posted losses of . Of course, stock investors are bound to turn to gold beneficiaries. Gold-related stocks include Koryo Zinc, Aegang Remetec, MK Electronics, Hansung ELCOMTECH, Glowork DI.Among them, Korea Zinc is the company whose stock price has risen the most this year. According to FnGuide, Korea Zinc's stock price increase rate compared to the beginning of the year as of Monday is . Shares of Korea Zinc, which was 10,000 won last month, rose to 10,000 won on Monday. Goryeo Zinc is a gold smelting company that obtains gold as a byproduct of zinc smelting.D.I. also saw its stock price rise significantly compared to the beginning of the year. DIA is a representative semiconductor inspection equipment company. On the other hand, Aegang Rimetec, Hansung Elcomtech, and Gloworks recorded a negative increase rate compared to the beginning of the year.However, Glowork's stock price growth rate was low compared to the beginning of the year, but the stock price has recently soared and is drawing attention. Shares of Gloworks, which used to be monthly won, rose to one. After that, there was also a request for inquiry disclosure related to the stock price surge of the exchange. In response, Gloworks recently said that there is nothing currently underway or confirmed as a matter that could affect the stock price surge.Eom Jin-seok, a researcher at Kyobo Securities, said, ""Even if a company is mentioned as a gold-beneficiary stock theme stock, the rise in gold prices does not have an absolute impact on stock prices,"" adding, ""It should be noted that gold and silver are the driving force for long-term stock prices, but other non-ferrous metals businesses.""In particular, even if a specific company announces disclosures related to gold mine development, it is important to clearly examine the credibility of the project.

"As most of the companies that started developing resources disappeared a few years ago, it is difficult to succeed in small and medium-sized enterprises in reality, so the lifespan of resource developers is limited by years. It turned out that most of the resource developers who appeared in a flurry around last year disappeared without making any significant results. It is pointed out that a small number of companies that still remain in the market are struggling to generate profits for resource development projects and only drain investors' funds.According to a Japanese-related industry, U-I Energy announced last month that it will increase its public offering capital by 100 million won. The company said it was raising funds to acquire a stake in Iraqi Kurdish oil fields and mines.UI Energy is a company acquired last year by Chairman Choi Kyu-sun, the main character of the Choi Kyu-sun gate case at the end of the Kim Dae Jung government. Since then, it has entered the resource development project and is carrying out resource development projects mainly in Iraq and the United States.Last year, a consortium of Korea's leading resource developers, including Korea National Oil Corporation and energy, was signed with the Iraqi Kurdish government to explore and produce the Bajian mine, but it has been stagnant since then. In fact, the company invested a large amount of funds, but its sales in the first half of this year were only KRW 100 million and operating losses were KRW 100 million, continuing its poor performance.The company raised hundreds of millions of won worth of funds through capital increase over the years based on contracts signed with Kurdish local governments. The problem is that even after investing so much money, it has not led to sales or profits due to the long exploration and development period and complicated local political conditions. In addition, it may not even be able to set the time of commercial production based on the results of scientific research on reserves.An official of the Korea National Oil Corporation said, ""The first drilling in the Bazian mine measured a lower-than-expected output,"" adding, ""It will take at least a few years to determine the actual economic feasibility and production capacity of the mine.""An official from UI Energy said, ""We are already producing a mining company that will acquire some of the shares through the bequest fund,"" but added, ""We cannot yet make an accurate estimate of the performance of many mining areas.""In addition, Gloworks, which is pursuing gold mine development in Mongolia, and Daehan New Farm, which is carrying out oil field development projects in Kazakhstan, have yet to produce meaningful results. Gloworks announced early last month that its Mongolian subsidiary had completed various procedures for gold mine production, but it has yet to set a specific sales time. The company's sales in the first half of this year are 100 million won and operating losses are 100 million won. Korea New Farm is also drilling in Kazakhstan's mining area, but there is a long way to go to commercial production. However, sales in the first half of this year recorded operating profit of 100 million won and 100 million won due to increased sales of medicines, which are existing business sectors.In the overseas resource development market, these companies are among the ones that have endured for a long time. According to the securities industry, including Daewoo Securities and the KOSDAQ Development Research Association, around last year, when the Lee Myung Bak government, which advocated resource diplomacy, added new resource development for business purposes. At that time, high oil prices continued to ignite resource development projects, and numerous companies declared crude oil, gold, and natural gas projects in Central Asia, including the Middle East and Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and attracted funds. At that time, it took advantage of the situation in which stock prices soared and funds were flocking to the resource development project.However, it is estimated that none of them has succeeded in developing resources. Only a few companies, including U.I. Energy, still maintain their reputation, are suffering from chronic deficits.An official from the KOSDAQ Development Research Council, which researched the data at the time, said, ""We do not currently have a specific list of individual companies because it was a long time ago,"" but added, ""We understand that most companies that promoted resource development at the time have failed.""Chung Geun-hae, an analyst at Woori Investment & Securities, also said, ""It is difficult for small and medium-sized companies to succeed due to the nature of resource development projects that require huge initial investment funds and take at least years.""He added, ""It is better to check the company's cash holdings and technology as a standard for verifying resource development companies and make investments after carefully examining whether they can develop resources,"" adding, ""Small and medium-sized companies should be careful about money games.""

"KOSDAQ-listed companies' quarterly earnings for monthly settlement were sluggish compared to the previous year, the report showed.According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, the monthly results of a survey of the company's opening of settlement corporations showed that sales amounted to 100 million won, compared to the same period last year While it was counted as an increase, operating profit and net profit turned into a deficit of 100 million won, respectively.In particular, opening companies in the financial sector, including E-Trade Securities, Korea General Capital, Korea Capital, Gemini Investment, and Global, performed poorly. Sales in the financial sector rose from a year earlier to 100 million won, but operating profit turned to a deficit of 100 million won, and net profit also recorded a deficit of 100 million won.Among financial stock companies, Korea Capital recorded an operating loss of KRW 100 million in the quarter of this year, making it the only company to turn into a deficit.

"Investors are required to pay attention as KOSDAQ companies, which have worsened their financial situation, are engaged in a series of small public offerings worth less than 100 million won.Small public offering is a system that allows companies to raise funds by submitting simple disclosure documents without submitting a securities report to the Financial Supervisory Service if they are offering less than 100 million won.Originally, it was intended to quickly support the financing of venture companies and small and medium-sized companies, but the criteria for small public offerings were strengthened from less than 100 million won to less than 100 million won last year due to a series of cases of abuse by marginal companies.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Turbo Tech, a security software company, decided to raise a paid-in capital increase worth billions of won late last month to raise operating funds. This is because the financial situation has worsened as it has suffered from a deficit in recent years due to sluggish sales. Although paid-in capital increase and bond issuance have been carried out several times, the capital erosion rate reaches .Last month, it also issued convertible bonds worth 100 million won as a small public offering. Stock prices, which were won at the end of last year, plunged to won due to growing concerns over dilution of stocks due to a series of capital increase and issuance of private bonds.Daewoo, which runs a plastic mold business, issued a total of 100 million won late last month. Daewoo Solar suffered a net loss for the current term until last year due to worsening operations. As the deficit continues, the company has issued paid-in capital increase corporate bonds every year, and the largest shareholder has also changed twice since the year, and management changes are frequent. Stock prices, which were won at the end of last year, fell to won.Glowworks, a resource development company, also carried out a paid-in capital increase and issuance of the capital increase worth 100 million won, respectively, respectively. Gloworks posted a net loss of 100 million won in the first half of this year following a series of losses in recent years. In the future, if a large-scale net loss occurs, it may be applied to the reason for designating a management item or the reason for delisting. The current stock price falls short of par in won.Experts advised that most companies that frequently hold small public offerings often use related systems as the last source of funds, and subscribers and existing shareholders should also pay special attention. Small public offerings are not protected, so there is a high concern that stock prices will be diluted.A researcher at a securities firm said, ""Small public offerings are attractive because they can attract funds in just a few days, but excessive public offerings will hurt existing shareholders due to the burden of volume,"" adding, ""In particular, there are many floating funds these days.""An industry source said, ""In view of the fact that ""Protective Jesus"" is not available, there are cases where people who are familiar with company information participate in small public offerings and profit from favorable news.""

"Resource developer Gloworks distributed a press release early in the morning. Former CEO of Actuo Park Sung-hoon, who was arrested by the prosecution on charges of embezzlement of hundreds of millions of won the previous day, and CEO Park Sung-hoon, a major shareholder of his company, were not the same person.Gloworks employees' voices were full of fatigue as they received inquiries from shareholders from the night before.In this era when the equation of abolishing the listing of major shareholders' embezzlement and breach of trust is naturally established, shareholders of Gloworks may have been unable to sleep at night. Even if the listing is delisted, employees will not have any difficulty in their livelihood if the company runs well, but shareholders' property losses will not be compensated.When a major shareholder was arrested on charges of embezzlement, listed affiliates under his control plunged all at once. Actuo and SCD fell more than Antipia, the largest shareholder of the lower limit of SCD. Another line, EduPass, is also at the bottom.According to the prosecution, Park is suspected of embezzling hundreds of millions of won in funds from these companies and causing hundreds of millions of won worth of damage to the companies in the process of acquiring wireless communication equipment companies and other companies. He is also suspected of pocketing hundreds of millions of won through stock trading using internal information.Actuo deepened his illness while expanding his business and filling his own interests in an illegal way. Losses, which stood at 100 million won a year, more than doubled to 100 million won last year.Hangul and computers, which are national software companies, are similar in their cases. It was classified as subject to a substantial review of delisting due to the embezzlement and breach of trust of about 100 million won by the brothers of President Kim Young-ik. Trading has been suspended for almost months.Recently, the former CEO's embezzlement of 100 million won has been revealed in Ingen, and the exchange has begun to review whether it is subject to a substantial review of delisting. In places like Agus, the representative disappeared with 100 million won.Among companies that have been delisted or listed this year following last year, there are many cases where major shareholder embezzlement has occurred.According to the Financial Supervisory Service, embezzlement and breach of trust have occurred in recent years in the opening of a company that was delisted last year. Among them, the total amount of embezzlement and breach of trust reached companies with more than the total amount of assets.There are various reasons for delisting, such as total capital erosion, corporate tax expense deduction, loss of continuous business, refusal of audit opinion, uncertainty of the ability to remain a company, and lack of sales of KRW 100 million over the years. All of these contents are linked to performance, so there is room for investors to review whether to invest.However, embezzlement and breach of trust is like a natural disaster, making it difficult to avoid massive investment losses. There is one hint to avoid thunderstormsHancom is an exception, but it is difficult to find a place with good performance considering where the owner's embezzlement occurs. Actuo did so and Agus was denied an opinion of thanks.A representative of a KOSDAQ company said, ""The embezzlement accident at a company with poor performance is either the collapse of the company or the temptation to embezzle when the company becomes difficult while the major shareholders are immersed in the thought of other pockets.""It cannot be said that there is no complete risk, but approaching based on performance means that the risk is low.Kim Yeon-woo, a researcher at Hanyang Securities, said, ""It is not easy for investors to notice embezzlement and breach of trust of major shareholders or insiders. However, considering that Actuo has no performance momentum and bad financial conditions, it is not necessary to invest in companies that do not support fundamentals.""

"The Financial Supervisory Service has launched an investigation into circumstances in which sales and operating profit prospects announced by bypass listed companies are inflated.According to financial authorities and industries last month, the Financial Supervisory Service launched an investigation after detecting circumstantial evidence that many of the companies listed indirectly from last year to this year excessively calculated their performance in estimated financial statements. According to an analysis of individual companies that announced bypass listing since the Capital Market Integration Act took effect last year, the actual sales of individual companies fell short of the estimate. Nice Metal Dragonfly Dongil Steel and others are representative. Neosemitech, which caused great damage to investors due to unfaithful disclosure and accounting manipulation, was also included.Among the more than two companies that announced the merger this year, sales fell short of estimates by the quarter, which are also expected to be difficult to meet estimated gains and losses. Among the places where the merger has been completed, Nspert, Sejin Electronics, and Bogwang Cyberdime are included.In terms of operating profit, the condition is more serious. Last year, only individual companies exceeded estimates, and companies recorded losses. This year's situation is the same, so there are actually operating profit items, but it is an indicator.In general, when a company is listed indirectly, it is assessed by an accounting firm to calculate the merger price. Accounting firms should conduct responsible monitoring when calculating the merger price, but accounting firms are also in a position to win business cases, making it difficult to conduct a fair review.Accordingly, the FSS plans to take measures to determine the responsibility of indirectly listed companies and accounting firms. An FSS official said, ""It will be difficult to prove the intention of the accounting firm,"" adding, ""If the company intentionally inflated it, it will have to take responsibility.""

"Listed KOSDAQ market companies, which are in the red or designated as management items, are raising funds one after another. Experts are calling for careful investment.According to the Japanese securities industry, listed companies on the KOSDAQ market continue to issue paid-in capital increase and convertible bonds with new stock rights to unspecified investors and shareholders.Both listed companies, which announced the issuance of paid-in capital increase this month, have even chosen a general public offering method after allocating shareholders. And among the companies that announced the issuance plan, the company will also raise funds through a public offering.The problem is that most listed companies on the KOSDAQ market, which open their hands to unspecified investors and shareholders, continue their deficit march or have been designated as management items.Maeil Merchant Marine, which announced that it would issue an unguaranteed domestic public offering worth billions of won to raise operating funds, posted a deficit in operating profit and net profit from the year to the first half of this year.Maeil Merchant Marine's small public offering document also states that accumulated operating losses from year to year-half continue to reach 100 million won, raising questions about its viability as a continuing company with operating losses of 100 million won as of the end of the year.Nice Metal, which has announced the issuance of hundreds of millions of won, is currently managed. According to a half-year report released last month, Nice Metal is in the red from last year to the first half of this year.Tongyang Telecom, which decided to increase its paid-in capital increase in general public offerings worth 100 million won, also saw a deficit in operating profit and net profit from last year to the first half of this year.In addition, Green Technology Investment Development and Kraze Industrial Development, which decided to increase capital by paid-in, also have poor performance.Green Technology Development said in its securities report that it recorded a net profit of about 100 million won in the first half of the year and turned into a surplus, but showed operating losses and net losses for consecutive business years from year to year.Kraze Industrial Development recorded a deficit in the first half of this year and in the second half of this year.In particular, as of the end of the year, it was said in a securities report that capital erosion could occur due to amortization of goodwill if the paid-in capital increase payment is lower than the initial plan or additional operating losses.An analyst in charge of small caps at a securities firm said, ""Some listed companies are moving to raise money quickly amid the rise in the stock market,"" stressing that many of them are raising funds to avoid capital erosion or amortization.Ahn Hyun-duk, a copyright holder, Financial News.

"Alpha Chips will make general subscriptions for two days from this coming day and begin the KOSDAQ listing process in earnest. It is the first semiconductor design company to be listed this year after SITI Image Technology Silicon Works. The public offering price has been fixed at 10,000 won. If it is listed, it will secure 100 million won in funds by offering a total of Manchuria.Alpha Chips is one of Samsung Electronics' customized semiconductor design houses, including C&S Technology Darwin Tech. Design houses are companies that place semiconductor circuits developed by fabless companies in accordance with the consignment manufacturer's mass-production process, and fabless companies usually leave them to design houses that are inexpensive when deploying circuits after the design stage.Alpha Chips has to overcome the fact that existing design house companies have struggled for a considerable period of time after listing and that fabless companies listed this year have performed poorly except Silicon Works. Image Technology saw its sales and operating profit decline by about in the first half of last year, respectively. SITI turned into an operating loss last quarter and has not escaped for a quarter. A researcher at a securities firm said, ""It is true that investors' interest in the semiconductor design industry has actually fallen a lot.""Sanghwa Microtech, which was in charge of the domestic design house, saw its sales rise to KRW last year after its listing, but continued to decline, falling to KRW 100 million last year. It was eventually acquired and merged with Nice Metal through bypass listing last year. Darwin Tech, which was listed on KOSDAQ last year, was incorporated as a subsidiary of the Soft Forum. Sales fell from KRW 100 million last year to KRW 100 million last year, and since last year, it has been in an operating deficit and has not escaped until the first half of this year. C&S Technology also recorded an operating loss for the past year in a row, but it has just escaped the deficit in the first half of this year.The reason why companies in this field struggled is that they are immediately affected by changes in foundry business conditions. Therefore, design houses developed their products without exception after listing. However, foundry and chip sales ride the flow of the game at the same time. There is a disadvantage that both businesses are bound to be affected during the semiconductor recession. In fact, sales of Darwin Tech and C&S Technology fell last year due to the economic crisis last year.Lee Jung-seung, deputy director of Alpha Chips, said, ""The existing design houses have rushed to design fabless products, and their performance has deteriorated due to entering the highly competitive market.""Alpha Chips recorded sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won in the first half of last year, when sales began to soar last year.Reporter Oh Eun...The requirements for the designation of a free economic zone in the foaming professional league will be strengthened for negotiations on the intellectual property rights of Trend Star Craft, which is caught by rhinitis at home.

"Amid controversy over lobbyists for outside directors, a large number of former high-ranking national tax officials have begun massive corporate restructuring to overcome last year's financial crisis. One of the restructuring measures proposed by the government at the time was the introduction of the outside director system.The government judged that the lack of efficiency and the resulting decrease in transparency due to the arbitrary management of business owners acted as a factor that led to the economic crisis. In order to solve such problems, an outside director system was introduced with the idea of appointing an outsider supervisor to monitor management.Under the current commercial law, listed corporations with a total asset amount of more than trillion won are required to appoint a majority of the total number of directors and general listed corporations with a total number of directors as outside directors.Currently, it is common for companies to appoint outsiders as outside directors. However, the reality is that companies' process of appointing outside directors is often subject to criticism. This is because it is pointed out that it has been reduced to a role of a show of hands, not a front-line bastion of transparent management.In other words, the basic purpose of introducing the system has become nominal.There is also considerable noise in the selection process.Some companies appoint people with strong political colors, such as appointing people who are closely related to the core of the administration, and some are encouraging controversy over the lobbying window of the government for outside directors by recruiting high-ranking officials such as economic ministries, prosecutors and police. According to a recent survey conducted by the Korea Listed Companies Council on the status of outside directors of listed companies on the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets, the CEO was appointed as an outside director.Among all outside directors, it was analyzed that . were former businessmen and . . were former professors and lawyers, respectively. The former civil servant was a relative minority of . However, there are many opinions that outside directors who are former public officials have more than just numerical value.In particular, the most popular candidates for recruitment of outside directors among former government officials include those from the National Tax Service. Currently, former national tax officials, regardless of their job salaries, are widely recruited and active as outside directors of each company.The reason why former national tax officials are popular is that companies covet the wide range of human networks they have, although their tax experience and knowledge accumulated during their current tenure are also valuable.In addition, considering the organizational characteristics of the National Tax Service, it is analyzed that companies are gaining popularity despite the controversy over lobbyists who stimulate their desire to purchase in the sense that they may be able to talk in case of problems. Who is an outside director from the National Tax Service? KOSPI Currently, outside directors from a former national tax official reach the dawn of the KOSPI KOSDAQ-listed companies. It covers from high-ranking officials to low-ranking officials who served as former head of the National Tax Service and local tax office.Their know-how in human network and tax administration is a property that cannot be obtained anywhere that does not disappear even after age. Considering this aspect, the controversy over the use of lobbyists such as tax audits is not a hindrance to companies at all.Lee Kun-chun, head of the National Tax Service, Son Young-rae, is serving as an outside director of the group Samcheon-ri Group, respectively. Last year, National Tax Service Commissioner Lee was appointed as an outside director of the group respectively last year.Kim Sung-ho and Park Chan-wook, head of the Seoul Regional Tax Office, serve as outside directors of Daishin Securities, while Oh Dae-sik, Lee Ju-seok, Jeon Hyung-soo, and Huh Byung-woo, head of the Seoul Regional Tax Office, are outside directors of Doosan Samsung Securities Korea Airport, respectively.Kim Ho-up, head of the Central Regional Tax Office, holds outside directorships of two companies, Dongbu Hi-Tech and Lotte Chilsung Beverage. Park Seok-hwan, head of the Central Regional Tax Office, is also an outside director with Samsung Heavy Industries.Kang Il-hyung, head of the Daejeon Regional Tax Office, and Kim Ho-ki, head of the Daegu Regional Tax Office, are serving as outside directors of Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Hysco, respectively. Kim also serves as an outside director of Dongbu Construction.Roh Seok-woo, Park Yong-oh, Cho Won-je, is an outside director of Hyundai Development and Energy, while Hwang Soo-woong, deputy director of the National Tax Service, is an outside director of Samsung Life Insurance and Shinsegae Food.Many former director-level officials are also serving as outside directors.Kim Chang-seop, head of the National Tax Service Education Center, recently hired Kim Yong-jae, a taxpayer protection officer at Cheil Industries, as an outside director of Lotte Insurance and Sebang.Min Tae-seop, Lee Hee-wan, director of the Seoul Regional Tax Office, is an outside director of Byeoksan Construction and Cheil Pharmaceutical, respectively. Choi Byung-chul, an international tax manager at the National Tax Service, is working with a business card for outside directors of Samho Development and Non-Life Insurance.Lee Sang-wi, head of Geochang Tax Office, Lee Hyang-gu, head of Dobong Tax Office, and Yoon Seok-beom, head of Seocho Tax Office, are working as outside directors of Samhwan Camu Juyeon Tech Gwangju Shinsegae, respectively. Who is an outside director from the National Tax Service? There are relatively few outside directors of KOSDAQ-listed corporations compared to outside directors of KOSPI-listed corporations. However, the name value is not behind at all.Kwak Jin-up, deputy director of the National Tax Service, serves as an outside director of Mnet Media, while Sung Sung-woong, Lee Jin-hak, director of Daegu Regional Tax Service, serves as an outside director of Jinro Fermentation Snet System, respectively. Lee is also serving as an outside director of Mnet Media with Kwak, deputy director of the National Tax Service.Lee Jae-man, Cho Yong-geun, head of the Daejeon Regional Tax Office, is an outside director of Dongyang Magic E-Tech Construction. Jang Chun-ki, head of the Central Regional Tax Office, also holds the title of outside director of Tarirasos Nice Metal, respectively.In addition, Bang Chun-seok, Anyang Tax Office Director Lee Jae-woo, Seodaemun Tax Office Director Lee Jae-wook, Busanjin Tax Office Director Lee Hak-soo, Bucheon Tax Office Director Je Yeon-hee, and Gumi Tax Office Director are also working as outside directors.Break the key guidelines that apply immediately to practice, the job barrier, the vocational competency systemKim Jin-young, a reporter for the Cho Se- Ilbo.The leader of Jose News, the daily newspaper.

"The KOSDAQ Market Headquarters of the Korea Exchange announced on the 1st that Nestek will be designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to the reversal of the inquiry disclosure.

"Nestek announced on the 1st that it has decided to issue bonds with new stock rights worth 100 million won to Woori Financial Savings Bank. The maturity interest rate is due on the date of the year.An official in charge of Nestek's stock said, ""The issuance was issued after the maturity of the previous billion won, and we will revitalize the existing business and enter new businesses, and the performance recovery will be visible by the month."" I talked to the person in charge in more detail. The use of 100 million won is. The issuance of KRW 100 million worth of issuance expired, so it was issued as a repayment. Some of the loans will be repaid and used as operating funds. What is the purpose of Woori Financial Savings Bank's investment? This time, Nestech's management watched the process of change, looked good on the future outlook, and started issuing refinancing. There's a separate bond and takeover rights. It was issued separately for now, and the future progress is to be decided by Woori Financial Savings Bank. Who is Jin Tae-won, who applied for the convening of an extraordinary shareholders' meeting and prohibition of the execution of the representative's duties? He is one of the minority shareholders. The reason why various lawsuits were rejected this time is that the company has decided to accept proposals from minority shareholders, including temporary shareholders' meetings. In other words, the court started mediation and the claimant canceled it on its own. It was designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to the cancellation of the decision to dispose of treasury stocks. As the stock price fell, I missed the timing to dispose of it. Memories of a month are used for any purpose. It is an operating fund. Some of them were issued to defend management rights, but as you know, our company had a large stake in minority shareholders and was well organized, so there was no significant effect. The CEO has been changed to Kim Tae-min, Jeon Pyeong-yeol, and Cho Wan-kyu. Former representative Kim Tae-min voluntarily resigned. CEO Jeon Pyeong-yeol was appointed from among the remaining executives. Minority shareholders have confidence in the former CEO's Is H1 Holdings the only major shareholder? Most of the rest are held at minority shareholders' meetings. CEO Cho Wan-kyu or some executives are minority shareholders. H1 was originally a major shareholder, but currently it has no management rights. Then we could sell our shares and go out. The stock price is cheap at the moment, so it won't be able to sell right now. I think we should make a profit. The company's sales are also sales, but its net operating profit is particularly bad. It is believed that H1 Holdings previously focused on other businesses such as golf courses rather than its main business. This time, the management has a part of reviving the existing business and thinking big about new things. I am planning to announce it soon. When will the performance recover? It will be visible from the month. Former CEO Kim transferred his existing business division to the other side, but he put it back in place. In fact, when I was only doing my original business, I could make a living. It is revitalized and new businesses are going deep. New sales start from the month. There will be many changes. It's a completely different side of the business so far.Reporter Lee Jae-Yoo...Ahn Cheol Soo President Lee is taking part in an investment briefing to select promising items for each theme"

"A company's directors and auditors as many as a general meeting of shareholders of thousands of candidates have a company name. Make one roof, three executives in the form of family and Nextech's story that is.Nextech businesses specialized in the production of a car the inauguration of the year to Geumsan industrial electronic devices, the Partial Fault Detection and Diagnosis of the vehicle producing companies, such as a scanner. Trade a day of the Export manbultap year and Ssangyong Motor, Hyundai Motor - scanner maintenance, including diagnosis devices in the delivery from growth, but years while the feud over control of the company has continued rapidly collapsed.Nextech month dates back to the feud over control of years. Nextech year, joined senior vice president of Nextech who was in deficit years on the CEO is gimyuo, restructuring. But year after year, CEO changes to the Kim Tae-Min, and former gimyuo is suspension of the performance of duties against Mr. Kim Tae-Min filed an injunction. But the dismissal of lawsuits and years under CEO Kim Tae-Min gimyuo at a shareholders meeting held in post management, including former dismissed.Proposed by the Board of Directors at a shareholders meeting at the time of jeonpyeongyeol jeonwontae baksseongjin who is nominated for director and shareholder proposal, Mr. Lee Sang-won Han Ji Hoon builhwan gimjinseong of director candidates are appointed not.Nextech month a year after is once again to convene a meeting demands from shareholders and temporary general meeting of shareholders, which was called up in a month a year also has been cancelled.Wall was continued internal bickering, but CEO years Mr. jeonpyeongyeol. Shareholder, Mr. jintaewon month a year date eventually asked for an extraordinary shareholders ` and again from the temporary general meeting of shareholders has opened.It would participate in as much as removal of a director of the issue was handled by a senior director of thousands of issue of thousands of items of an auditor. Dismiss a result, current CEO jeonpyeongyeol was spared, but they managed to dominate the majority of the Board of Directors Board of shareholder proposal.First, the removal of a director of the current internal matter but was rejected, but was dismissed his chief executive officer at jeonpyeongyeol jeonwontae, director and Non executive Directors, lose their jobs.Senior executive shareholders withheld their name, company name issue for shareholder proposals but suggested the name company proposal has been named the name. As a result, the number of shareholder-proposed directors will surpass those of Kwon Young-jung, Jung Young-hwan, Cho Wan-kyu, and Yoon Byung-wook, including Lee Seung-min, Kim Jung-ho, who were proposed by the company, and former CEO Pyeong-yeol.Auditor Park Chul-hee, who was proposed by shareholders, was also appointed for the appointment of auditors.It seems that Nestek's management rights have been transferred to shareholders. However, the composition of shareholders is also a mixture of shareholders who have been in conflict for a long time, H1 Holdings, the current largest shareholder, and newly entering the conflict. Director Cho Wan-kyu, who was appointed as a shareholder proposal on the month after the shareholders' meeting, was appointed as the representative of each company along with CEO Jeon Pyeong-yeol.Since last year, Nestek has been through Kim Yu-ho, Kim Tae-min, former CEO of Pyeong-yeol, Cho Wan-kyu, and many directors have attempted to take control of the company. In the process, operating profit, which was KRW 100 million per year, decreased to KRW 100 million per year and turned into a deficit from that year. As the company suffered from numerous transactions, its net profit recorded a loss of KRW 100 million per year from KRW 100 million per year to KRW 100 million per year. In the quarter of this year, it suffered a net loss of 100 million won in operating losses and partially eroded capital.Nestek, which continues to have a management dispute like three families with one roof. The large-scale extraordinary shareholders' meeting, which has been held for nearly years, has ended, but I wonder how the uneasy cohabitation with shareholders and former executives will proceed.For your information, the following was announced as a result of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on last month.Repudiation of In-house Director Jeon Pyeong-yeol, Repudiation of In-house Director Jeon Pyeong-yeol, Repudiation of In-house Director Jeon Won-tae, Repudiation of Out-of-house Director Kim Won-il, Repudiation of Out-of-house Director Kim Dae-ho, Repudiation of Out-of-house Director Kwon Young-hwan, Repudition According to Park Chul-hee's original plan, Lee Joon-young, Woo Sang-soon, and individual investors are crying over how much they earned from their own stock transactions.

"The plunge in the global stock market, which has downgraded the U.S. credit rating, has also caused the local stock market to fall into disbelief as it continues to soar every day. Concerns over a slowdown in the global economy add to anxiety in the stock market, and despite the box-office trend, individuals are only losing money due to wrong countermeasures and strategies.According to a market analysis by the Korea Investment & Securities Co., the KOSPI index soared by about 100 million won as institutions bought nearly 100 million won despite selling foreign futures the previous day. In particular, Dongyang Iron & Steel, Solgo Bio, Hynix, Edubox, Apro Technology, Edubox, Shinwon Juyeon Tech, Hanjin Shipping, and Amore Dongyang Hite Holdings, Korea Steel Puts Lotte Shopping, Lotte Samgang, Life Sciences, Chemical, Health Bukwang Pharmaceutical, Hyundai Elevator, Hansol Paper, Hite closed lower.In particular, the Korea Investment Institute said that short-term investment needs to be changed to short-term investment due to the burden of the global stock market's surge, and recommended short-term bond sales by C&K, Inter, Neowiz, Internet, Agabang Company, and Daum.In addition, the main investment association said that gold insurance, investment securities, sports, and such stocks should be refrained from trading, and it is necessary to approach them with short-term responses such as front-line new drugs, Jungwoo Pharmaceutical Holdings, and finance.In addition, theme stocks show an abnormal surge as institutional and individual supply and demand are driven to the KOSDAQ due to a sharp drop in KOSPI large-cap stocks, including the presidential election and bio-themes. In addition to Boryeong Median, Agabang Company, Solgo Bio, Biospaces, MetaBiomed, which is considered a beneficiary of candidate Park Geun Hye, and Daehyun PSMC Barun Electronics Motors, Seo Hee Construction, which is considered a beneficiary of candidate Moon, Jungwoo Pharmaceutical, and Medipost Choa Coentech are also showing a sharp rise.In this market situation, individual investors are repeating huge losses due to excessive chase buying and dumping every time, and individuals who are unable to make profits alone should visit Jusuyeon for help.

"In the stock market, which has been examined in the recent main investment, individual investors need to pay attention to stocks that cannot support their performance or corporate growth and are soaring due to simple issues and themes. Of course, these soaring theme stocks can make high profits in the short term, but individual investors who are not good at setting timing and responding to sales are mostly losing money in the short term in the aftermath of a sharp drop due to a sharp rise.According to the analysis of the main investment bank, Hynix, Persis, Display, Dongkuk Steel, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, etc., which belong to KOSPI, showed a sharp drop, while stocks classified as economic defense stocks such as Nongshim, Cheil Worldwide, NCsoft, Kyungbang, and CheilJedang showed a sharp rise.In the stock market, small and medium-sized performance stocks and companies that are insensitive to the economy are on the rise due to concerns over a global economic slowdown, while small and medium-sized performance stocks such as Aurora, Wonik, and Hyundai Telecom are classified as economic defense stocks.In addition, theme stocks show an abnormal surge as institutional and individual supply and demand flocked to the KOSDAQ due to the sharp drop in KOSPI large-cap stocks, including the presidential election and bio-themes. In addition to Boryeong Median, Agabang Company, Solgo Bio, Biospaces, MetaBiomed, which is considered a beneficiary of Moon Jae In, and Daehyun PSMC Barun Electronics Motors, Seo Hee Construction, Jungwoo Pharmaceutical, Sanseong P&C Medipost, and R&L Bio, which are also seen as beneficiaries of Moon Jae In.The investment strategy proposed by the Korea Stock Exchange is more stable for individual investors to buy and sell domestic consumption or economic defense stocks that are exploring overseas markets in the first half of the year, especially among stocks with low performance expectations.However, individuals who are unable to make a profit alone should visit the next stock cafe, Joo Tu-yeon, for help.A group of experts from Jusuyeon, run by Jung Woo-jin, an investment expert who produces numerous broadcasting experts every year, has not been able to catch up with the unrealistic advertising of ultra-low-priced stocks.I hope you can find an opportunity here to become rich in stocks with hundreds of returns as well as recovering principal, which is not a victim of the loss of ordinary investors.

As the reason for being designated as a management item is the loss of business continuously, it is inevitable to re-evaluate the presidential election shipbuilding.If the soundness classification is re-classified according to each bank's credit rating model, there is a possibility that the burden of provisions will increase in the future.According to the Japanese banking sector, credit contributions from each bank to the presidential election shipbuilding amounted to a total of billions of won.Among commercial banks, Woori Bank has the largest amount of credit. It is reaching 100 million won as of the month and year. Hana Bank is followed by Korea First Bank with 100 million won. Kookmin Bank's credit contribution is 100 million won.

"This article was shipped to the Professional Information Service created by Money Today on Monday.Restructuring of shipbuilders is expected to begin in earnest due to worsening liquidity caused by a series of orders. Financial supervisory authorities and creditors are announcing their plan to conduct intensive restructuring of shipbuilders as soon as last year's settlement results are released.In particular, small and medium-sized shipbuilders with relatively weak financial capacity are expected to face a large-scale exit. According to Clarkson, an international shipbuilding analysis agency at risk of small and medium-sized shipbuilders due to the delay in the cancellation of orders, only a handful of ships were ordered from around the world last year. The number of ships dropped sharply from the previous telegram. This is the lowest level since the year. Due to the decrease in the volume of orders placed, the remaining orders of domestic shipbuilders decreased.The reduction in orders is also a problem, but the bigger problem is that there are a number of cases of postponement of delivery and cancellation of contracts for existing ships.Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the world's leading company in terms of remaining orders, canceled its contract with a European shipbuilder last year. Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and other Hyundai Heavy Industries Group have won orders from Greece, which is in a financial crisis, and it cannot rule out further cancellation of orders or delays in payment due to the financial crisis in southern Europe. Earlier last month, Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction terminated its supply contract for container ships.The industry's dominant view is that the cases of Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries are only the tip of the iceberg.An industry source said, ""In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, there have been more cancellations of contracts due to difficulties in financing,"" adding, ""There will be more cancellations of small contracts that are not mandatory for disclosure.""Large listed corporations with total assets of more than trillion won must disclose the details of the contract if the contract amount exceeds the sales amount. Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries announced the cancellation of the contract because the order itself exceeded the amount of sales. In the case of shipbuilders with small orders, it is reported that there are cases where the amount of contract cancellation is discussed to avoid the disclosure obligation.In fact, the case of an unlisted shipbuilder's cancellation of an order is not just yesterday. Daehan Shipbuilding and Shipbuilding, which entered the workout last year, have already experienced a series of contract cancellations since early last year.The banking sector is warning of the risk of exchange losses due to cancellation of orders or postponement of delivery.An official from the banking sector said, ""The shipbuilders' earnings will be released soon, and liquidity pressure due to cancellation of orders or postponement of delivery will be severe,"" adding, ""The shipbuilder, which said it is relatively superior except for large companies, will also be affected.""In the industry, shipbuilding, shipbuilding, shipbuilding, shipbuilding, heavy industry, and heavy industry are mentioned as companies that suffer from exchange losses.According to the operating guidelines for regular corporate credit risk assessment of shipbuilders prepared by the Korea Federation of Banks last year, if the foreign exchange hedge ratio exceeds the level, it is classified as subject to eviction. As small and medium-sized shipbuilders will inevitably be expelled, it is not only cancellation of orders or postponement of delivery. Most small and medium-sized shipbuilders are likely to be included in the list of evictions in the creditors' common evaluation criteria for the shipbuilding industry, such as their status in the industry, balance of orders, and shipbuilding experience.According to Clarkson statistics, Samho Shipbuilding, Century Shipbuilding, Jinse Shipbuilding, Sekwang Heavy Industries, Nokbong Shipbuilding, Segwang Shipbuilding, etc. are classified as below the world ranking based on order balance. Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, Seongdong Dockyard, Korean Dockyard, Presidential Shipbuilding, Samho Shipbuilding, Century Shipbuilding, Sekwang Heavy Industries, etc. have a backlog of orders less than a year.In the financial sector, many of the shipbuilders that received ratings in last year's credit risk assessment are expected to be classified as eligible for eviction this year.An official from the shipbuilding industry said, ""If the shipbuilding market is to improve in earnest, it must be a year at the latest,"" stressing the need for restructuring, saying, ""There is no answer to the short-lived business.""The banking sector is also making clear its opposition to unconditional support for shipbuilders. A bank official said that small and medium-sized shipbuilders have weak credit ratings, making it difficult to continue supporting them.An official from the financial authorities said, ""We will evaluate credit risk in accordance with the guidelines for the regular evaluation of shipbuilders this year,"" hinting that the number of people who received good ratings in last year's evaluation could increase.

"The increase in the limit of support for shipbuilding loans, the sharing of double support for mercury and water conservancy, etc. will be difficult this year.Both the shipbuilding industry and the expert government predict that the shipbuilding and shipping economy will not be able to revive easily. The number of orders has decreased As China's low-priced offensive continues, small and medium-sized shipbuilders are struggling day by day.Shipbuilders continue to flow funds smoothly through the incoming advance and intermediate payments when new orders are placed. Since the end of last year, new orders have decreased sharply, further increasing difficulties in the shipbuilding industry. In the end, large companies that survived are maintaining their reputation through business diversification, and small and medium-sized companies are becoming more polarized. This is why the government has taken out a comprehensive support plan for the shipbuilding industry.Support for mid-sized shipbuilders is the largest part of the comprehensive measures for shipbuilding due to the double chisel of mercury protection, which is the expansion of shipbuilding financing by the Export-Import Bank of Korea and easing the support conditions of the Export Insurance Corporation. Through this, it is expected that not only large companies but also mid-sized shipbuilders will be able to breathe.In the case of mercury manufacturing finance, it is much higher than last year.I increased the funding limit and expanded network loans to support suppliers. As of the end of last month, production finance was KRW trillion and network loans were KRW trillion.Soubou decided to invest KRW trillion by easing the conditions of guarantee for cash settlement. Among them, it plans to support large companies and small and medium-sized companies on a large scale. Current conditions include more than KRW trillion in sales in recent years and less than the ratio of loans that meet credit rating requirements. As a result, mid-sized shipbuilders such as Seongdong Shipbuilding and Daesun Shipbuilding are expected to gain strength.In addition, Soubou will temporarily raise its mid- to long-term export insurance coverage rate from this year and actively consider providing mid- to long-term export insurance to ships ordered by Korean foreign shipping companies through the establishment of overseas subsidiaries or special purpose corporations.Some parts, such as sharing the ratio of ship collateral loans, are difficult, but as the value of ship collateral falls, the knot has not been easily solved on how the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Corporation will share a certain portion of the additional collateral. This is because it is difficult for us to come forward first without the creditors' position on the world's leading shipping company that applied for a bailout from the French government. In particular, Soubou is known to feel some pressure due to concerns over the loss of funds due to the application for the Joseon workout.Due to the worsening economy, shipping companies, including the , have suffered shortages as ship prices fell from the time of the order, and for this reason, some ships have not been delivered. Therefore, if support is provided for this, it will be possible to deliver a ship that has not been handed over to the shipping company even after completion of construction. Typically, in the case of Hyundai Heavy Industries, shipowners do not deposit the delivery money, so Chuck's ship is floating in the sea due to the problem.The dilemma of expanding government support for the shipbuilding industry is that the government is considering expanding support for the shipbuilding industry. Compared to other industries, the amount of support is too large and competition for low-priced orders is fierce, so we cannot be sure about the competitiveness of small and medium-sized companies. In other words, the big dilemma is that support and restructuring must be combined.Moreover, it is inevitable that major countries such as Europe will be cautious about strengthening Korea's support over subsidies. Recently, the European Federation of Shipbuilders raised the issue, saying that Korean shipbuilders received low-cost orders.Yang Jeong-dong, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co., said, ""As shipbuilding is an industry that creates a lot of employment, the government is expected to go as far as possible to prevent bankruptcy, but it is uncertain whether the recession will be structurally beneficial to the national economy.""Reporter Hwang Jung-won...Free download of Star Pictorial"

"It is essential to check a company's balance sheet for differentiated value investment strategic value investment by Leadstone Investment Advisory. This is to understand the value of the company specified in the book. But this work is absolutely fundamental. In order to select value stocks more closely, you need your own distinct standards and analysis methods.Leadstone Investment Advisory has a firm standard in this respect. If a general value investment is to approach the concept of a balance sheet and cut a cross-section of a company, Leadstone Investment Advisory approaches the concept of a profit and loss statement. This means that it focuses on the concept of cash flow, that is, what a company's cash flow is like. In particular, it evaluates the value of a company based on analysis.Ryu Choong-seok, Kim Seong-hoon, and Leadstone, co-chairman of investment advisory, said, ""Although we usually analyze a lot of things when we take over a company, we rely only on technical analysis."" As it has strengths in approach and analysis at the level, most of the major customers of Leadstone Investment Advisory are listed companies. Representative examples are Joseon internal fire, presidential election, Chosun Holdings, Ilyang Construction, and UNGEL DIC. In fact, some customers have successfully acquired healthy companies with potential with the help of Leadstone investment advice.In addition, what co-chairman Ryu Choong-seok and Kim Sung-hoon consider important is risk management. Rather than investing in pursuit of profits, it is a principle to invest faithfully in the basics of finding good companies and obtaining profits incidentally while managing risks.From this point of view, which companies are discovered and invested by Leadstone Investment Advisory? Co-CEO Ryu Choong-seok and Kim Sung-hoon cited four major promising companies as examples.Judging by its sustainable profits, SFA's sales fell year-on-year to 100 million won last year, and its order balance was only about 100 million won. Earlier this year, the outlook for the year was quite unclear. However, Leadstone Investment Advisory recorded double-digit operating profit ratio over the past year and recorded it last year. The operating profit ratio was judged to be a temporary phenomenon that occurred in the worst business situation.In addition, it is expected that the display equipment system, logistics system, etc. will recover sales as usual because it is a business that can grow steadily every year. As of the end of last year, considering the long-term operating profit ratio of 100 million won in net cash and 100 million won in sales, Leadstone Investment Advisory bought stocks earlier this month, judging that the market capitalization of 100 million won was undervalued.Co-CEO Ryu Choong-seok and Kim Sung-hoon said, ""Company value should be judged based on long-term sustainable profits, not short-term profits.""Kolon Industries, which pays attention to companies that spin off, is a company that was re-listed last month after spin-off from Kolon at the end of last year. Leadstone Investment Adviser estimated Kolon Industries' sales of billions of won and net profit of hundreds of millions of won earlier this year, which is now above expectations.Some said that the net deposit of KRW trillion was an unstable factor, but Leadstone Investment Advisory judged that it would sufficiently offset the cost of borrowing with an Evita of KRW 100 million. In other words, the company accepted the fact that it continues to invest rather than reduce borrowing, meaning that the company is confident of the long-term growth of the business.Co-CEO Ryu Choong-seok and Kim Sung-hoon explained, ""Even in the case of the U.S., investing in spin-off companies beats the market in the long run,"" adding, ""This is because sometimes, when spin-off companies do not reflect the actual operating value.""In the case of advanced companies with two favorable factors, low valuation and spin-off, it is a company with two factors: temporary profit deterioration and spin-off. Advanced performance in the first half of this year was not good. In addition, net loss for the period was temporarily recorded in the quarter due to short-term foreign currency borrowings.However, Leadstone Investment Advisory judged that it is quite undervalued that the market capitalization of a company with operating profit ratio is traded at around KRW 100 million in sales. In addition, it is believed that it will be the most undervalued company among listed companies next year as it will be divided into a holding company system and will fall to the level of simple business companies. Shinsegae Food, a high corporate preference, is double the previous year's standard and more than double this year's forecast. Or it may not be a value stock that is generally thought of as . However, Shinsegae Food's annual sales growth rate is the average year after year.It's calculated by double.Just as Samsung Electronics invests in internalizing parts due to low growth rates of finished home appliances, Shinsegae, which has almost finished opening its E-Mart store, is making efforts to make products, said co-CEO Ryu Choong-seok and Kim Sung-hoon. Therefore, Shinsegae Food, which is increasing its own products based on E-Mart's infrastructure, is highly likely to grow.Leadstone Investment Advisory's investment philosophy is to invest in companies with high long-term prospects with the attitude of acquiring companies.Co-CEO Ryu Choong-seok and Kim Seong-hoon, co-CEO Ryu Choong-seok graduated from Korea University and worked for Dongwon Securities' corporate finance team and Samcheon-ri's new business team. Kim Sung-hoon, a co-chairman of Brown University's economics department and Yale University, also joined Dongwon Securities for the first time. After that, he is a financial veteran who has gone through the New York Department of Corporate Finance and Deutsche Bank's corporate finance team.The two people, who first formed a relationship at Dongwon Securities, joined forces again as they shared their will to investment advisory business. Co-CEO Ryu Choong-seok and Kim Sung-hoon, who founded Leadstone Investment Advisory, received investment advice and discretionary business approval from the Financial Supervisory Commission last month and began working in earnest the following month.Leadstone Trust, the leading fund of Leadstone Investment Advisory set up on the month, has posted a return of . in recent years as of the month. The cumulative return after setting is . It is a remarkable figure despite the financial crisis.Currently, Leadstone Investment Advisory operates high investment securities and advisory lab products, and plans to operate advisory lab in partnership with Korea Educational Guarantee Fund this year.

"The stock return in the first half of this year, which is a report card for companies representing Busan as well as places, fell far short of the average return on the entire stock market, the report showed.Dong-A Ilbo and Hi Investment & Securities jointly surveyed the stock price fluctuations of companies listed on the Korea Exchange among the top sales companies in Busan last year.Among the top companies in sales last year, Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction, Busan Bank, and Korea Steel were listed. The company calculated the first-half return by comparing the closing price of last year and the closing price of last month.According to the survey, the average return of these individual companies remained at . Considering that the average return of all companies listed on the KOSPI market is . in the first half of this year, the performance of listed companies in Busan seems to be relatively lower.Among individual companies, only voice actor Hi-Tech and others recorded positive returns. The rest of the companies recorded negative returns. There were also places that recorded a major return.Individually, thanks to Hyundai Motor's strong performance, parts maker Sungwoo Hi-Tech posted the largest return in the first half of this year.Sebang, a port loading and unloading cargo gateway company, also posted a high return of . on the back of a recovery in container traffic at Busan Port in the first half of the year. Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co. and Michang Oil Co. followed.On the other hand, due to the slump in the shipbuilding industry and poor performance, the presidential election, shipbuilding, and Hyunjin materials fell sharply.Stock prices of Daehan Steel and Korea Special Steel Co., Ltd. were also struggling due to a drop in steel demand due to the sluggish construction industry nationwide.Busan Bank, which posted a net profit of more than 100 billion won last year, also recorded a .1 profit rate in the first half of the year as financial stocks turned weak in the wake of the recent financial crisis from abroad.Taewoong Island, which has recently been in the spotlight for green energy and is called the leader of wind power generation, also failed to meet expectations due to its return.However, Taewoong's performance is expected to improve in the second half of the year as orders have been recovering since last quarter, with a clear recovery in wind power, although he has not recovered in the shipbuilding and plant sectors. Accordingly, wind-related companies that are relatively distributed in the Busan area are instilling expectations.In addition, Busan Bank's stock price outlook is expected to be bright in the second half as expectations for bank and financial stocks are rising amid the recent easing of the financial soundness test for European banks.Kim Seung-han, head of Dongnae branch of Hi Investment & Securities, said, ""Busan's leading companies were shunned in the stock market in the first half of the year due to sluggish performance after the financial crisis.However, some were wary of excessive optimism at a time when concerns about the global economic slowdown and double dip still exist.""Although the weather forecast for companies in Busan has stopped raining, there are still dark clouds,"" said Roh Hyo-jong, head of research at Korea Investment & Securities.Reporter Lee Sang-yoon.

"It's sun sauce.Hello, I'm Kim Byung-geun from the Ministry of Industry of Money Today. Today, I would like to recommend checkpoints that should be considered when investing in a company and the stocks that follow. When you invest in a company, you have to look at two main things.Currently, the entire market is driven by displays such as and laptops. Therefore, display-related companies will benefit. Another checkpoint is whether you have entered the core process of the phase from epi-wafer to packaging.Based on this, Lumens and Seoul Semiconductor Woori ITI RT Electronics can be cited as beneficiaries.First of all, Lumens has explained earlier, so I will tell you about Topaz, an unlisted affiliate. It's a trend to light up from the side. A light guide plate that converts the light coming in from the side to the front is essential for the E-fat diet, and Topaz is dominating the market for the light guide plate. Stock industry sources estimate that sales from last year's 100 million won will exceed 100 million won this year. Experts share the view that this profit is reflected in Lumens' equity method profits, which increases the value of Lumens' investment.The second is Daejangju Seoul Semiconductor. Since it first entered the packaging market for the quarter last year, Seoul Semiconductor has started mass-production in earnest this month. It is understood that it has recently started mass-production not only for domestic but also for overseas panel companies. Yong sales are expected to account for the largest portion of total sales this year.It should not be missed that Akrich, an exchange light source only made by Seoul Semiconductor, is doing well in overseas markets. Although sales have previously been mainly generated by small companies, it is attractive that they are recently doing business with top companies such as W and Philips. You can see that technology is starting to get recognized in the world. As POSCO participates in the allocation of capital, it is important to watch how the cooperation between the two companies will develop in the future.Our ITI business is also on a growth track this year. The company is developing a dragon with a display following its traditional laptop packaging. The industry expects related sales to increase to 100 million won this month and 100 million won by the end of the year.Alti Electronics is also on the beneficiary list. This company is run by its affiliate, Alti Semiconductor Sales are expected to increase from last year's 100 million won to 100 million won this year. It is a collaboration between small and medium-sized packaging and lighting such as laptops and monitor cell phones.

"The introduction directly reflects the performance of its parent company. Parent companies with recommended subsidiaries such as Alti Electronics and Woori TI are screaming happily thanks to the reflection of their subsidiaries' performance following the introduction of international accounting standards.According to the Japanese-related industry, securities firms have been recommending listed companies with good subsidiaries such as Alti Electronics, Woori EITI Doosan Infracore, and grandchildren ahead of its introduction from this year.Hi Investment & Securities said on the same day that Alti Electronics, a manufacturer of mobile phone parts and light emitting diode lighting, has increased its investment value due to a surge in performance of its subsidiary Alti Semiconductor. Alti Semiconductor, a chip packaging company, increased its annual production capacity from 10,000 to 100 million last year and predicted that its sales will reach 100 million won this year, more than half of Alti Electronics' sales.As a result, Alti Electronics' operating profit this year is expected to double last year to 100 million won, and its sales are expected to double to 100 million won. Song Myung-seop, an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities, said the company's performance will improve as the company's performance improves due to strong business conditions.Hana Daetoo Securities also analyzed that in the case of ITI, an information technology component company, the growth momentum has increased as its subsidiary Woori enters the packaging business. Meanwhile, Eugene Investment & Securities recommended Doosan Infracore Solomon Investment & Securities as a beneficiary of the growth of its subsidiaries.Listed companies with substantial subsidiaries are drawing attention because the introduction of the system has led to the performance of subsidiaries with a stake or higher being reflected in their parent companies.Under the current accounting standards, all companies with above shares are subject to consolidation, but gains and losses in the equity method are only recognized as sales items. However, subsidiaries that are less than institutionalized are treated in the existing way, while the equity ratio or higher reflects the net income of the subsidiary's sales and operating profit in the parent company's consolidated financial statements.The recent increase in listed companies that embrace subsidiaries at all, including Maeil Dairy's merger with its subsidiary Shanghai earlier this month, is also to avoid inconvenience in creating consolidated financial statements.Lee Ga-won, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co., said, ""With the full introduction next year, subsidiaries' performance has become more important, which has emerged as an important point for the parent company's investment.""Reporter Choi Soo-moon...Free download of Star Magazine Choi Soo Moon"

"The electronic parts industry is full of joy due to Samsung effect. Thanks to Samsung Electronics' record-high performance in the off-season quarter, its partners are also doing well by releasing report cards that are overshadowed by the off-season.A-Tech Solution announced that its sales and operating profit recorded KRW 100 million, respectively, in the last quarter. It is an increase from the previous year. Net profit rose to 100 million won. All three indicators are the largest in history on a quarterly basis.This solid performance is due to the good performance of Samsung Electronics' businesses such as home appliances. This is because the better the home appliances sell, the higher the demand for molds from the company.A company official said, ""The quarterly performance is due to the good sales of Wa home appliances,"" and expected that sales of light-emitting diode lead frames will also begin and performance will improve in the quarter.Space Electronics achieved sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won last quarter, respectively. It is an increase compared to the same period last year. The securities industry believes that Samsung Electronics produces more than its total sales, mainly due to its ultra-precision connector business for liquid crystal displays and mobile phones.Partron also released a report card comparable to last year's peak season performance, with sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won in the last quarter. The company's main business is antennas for mobile phones.In the case of Alti Electronics, its Chinese subsidiary turned into a surplus early thanks to its growing volume. It is known that a Chinese corporation that makes hinges for mobile phones began mass production in the second half of last year and has surpassed the break-even point in a quarter. Considering that it usually takes more than months to years for overseas corporations to make profits, it is said to be unusual.An industry source said, ""As Samsung Electronics is aggressively marketing not only in mobile phones but also in the home appliance business, the off-season is gradually disappearing in the parts industry,"" adding, ""We expect more from the quarter when it enters the peak season.""

This is due to the acquisition of bonds with new stock rights issued by Envix.In the stock market, attention is being paid to whether foreign warrent hunters, who have been quiet for a while, will resume their activities.An investment bank official said, ""Foreign investors tend to make profits by buying or short selling stocks of listed companies with better conditions than fundamentals, or by raising interest rates in case of default,"" adding, ""Financial authorities have imposed sanctions on them.""The so-called warrent hunters, including Peter Beck & Partner Amherance Oasis, who were in crisis after the financial crisis, have withdrawn from the local stock market for a while. In particular, Peter Beck & Partner, which is known to have suffered enormous damage from its investment in Warren, is still recovering its losses by selling its holdings. Some in the securities industry analyze that Peter Beck, who has become difficult to realize quick profits due to sanctions by financial authorities, is gradually moving the stage of his activities to China and Southeast Asia. However, there are many concerns about the expansion of foreign capital investment.Stock market experts said, ""In general, when stock prices fall, bond interest can be exercised to earn capital gains when stock prices rise,"" adding, ""In particular, companies with good corporate value can even threaten management rights when exercising their rights.""Although there are not many cases of converting to stocks due to the recent sluggish KOSDAQ market, some point out that it could be a burden of volume as it remains a potential sale. Warren hunters use a profit-taking strategy that secures a certain level of self-interest and borrows stocks and sells them at a price higher than the exercise price. If the stock price of the stock falls significantly, buy the stock back in the market and return it, and if the stock price does not fall, I exercise and repay the stock.An official from the securities industry said, ""With the recent revival of the stock market, companies are raising funds through issuance again,"" adding, ""Investors should carefully consider when such bonds can be converted into stocks.""Meanwhile, domestic investment companies are also turning to investment recently.

"Improving the financial structure is positive, but it will rise only when its performance is supported. Recently, more and more KOSDAQ-listed companies have paid back money borrowed from financial companies, but the stock prices of those companies have not been on the report showed. Experts stress that repayment of loans has the effect of improving the corporate financial structure, but that in order for stock prices to rise, performance, which is the essence of the company, must be supported.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, KOSDAQ companies that announced that short-term loans decreased in the second half of this year reached the total number. Weaport Co., a Chinese listed company, announced on the last day that short-term loans from its subsidiary Zhejiang A Special Electricity Co., Ltd. have decreased by 100 million won. This is the amount of equity capital as of the end of last year. The company said it paid back short-term loans to improve its financial structure.Pacanoffi, which manufactures organic photoreceptor drums and chips, also announced that it has repaid short-term loans worth 100 million won to the Korea Development Bank to improve its Japanese financial structure. With more than equity capital, Mr. Pacanoffi's remaining short-term borrowings have been reduced to hundreds of millions of won. In addition, Ice Station Nvix FineTech and others repaid short-term loans exceeding that of their equity capital in the second half of the year, while JVM and ASE Tech AD Chips also paid back the money they borrowed for the purpose of improving their financial structure.Experts evaluated that companies that are steadily repaying short-term loans are positive because the risk of financial structure is lowered. The CEO of a KOSDAQ company said, ""It is common for companies that are trying to improve their financial structure through repayment of short-term loans to have a fresh start."" A researcher at a securities firm also explained, ""Some companies may repay loans in a hurry due to maturity, but the fact that they repay loans to improve their financial structure can be seen as an expression of confidence.""However, it was found that such short-term loan repayment had little effect on stock prices. In fact, only one of these companies has seen their stock prices rise since the announcement, including Wayport Co., Ltd. and JPM, while Pacan OFC, AD Chips, Ice Tation, Nvix, Fine Tech, and ASEA Tech have been on the decline. A researcher at a securities firm advised that the repayment of short-term loans is positive news in that the financial structure will improve for now, but corporate earnings should be supported to lead to a rise in stock prices.Reporter Hwang Jung-soo...

"Although listed companies, such as stock price hikes due to investment in new business facilities of COABRIDES and U-Precision, have announced the same paid-in capital increase, stock prices are mixed depending on the purpose and size of the capital increase.Envix, which announced a paid-in capital increase on the last day, fell sharply to the won, which was the won on the day of the capital increase announcement, in three days, including the lower limit on the last day. NNT, which announced a paid-in capital increase, was also pushed from won to won during the trading day.The reason why stock prices fall due to paid-in capital increase is that, above all, the rights of existing shareholders are diluted as the number of stocks increases significantly.

An analyst at a securities firm said, ""If we raise capital to raise operating funds, it will often be hit by stock prices,"" adding, ""This is because it is interpreted as a lack of financial power of the company.""On the other hand, some stocks are rather encouraged by the disclosure of a paid-in capital increase. This is a case where capital increase funds are expected to be used to invest in new facilities to help improve performance.Corebreed, which announced its capital increase last day, saw its stock price soar from won to won over the next trading day.

"The KOSDAQ disclosure, which investors saw the most in this week, was by far the merger-related report.Most of all, the merger report submitted to merge with A drew attention from investors as it was pointed out that it did not reflect the loss of equity methods of subsidiaries that submitted financial statements by applying special accounting standards for SMEs.During the trading days when the transaction was suspended and resumed from the past.

"KOSDAQ-listed companies, which have heard the news of the sale of shares of the largest shareholders such as BS STNBIX, plunged a lot. Analysts say this is the result of growing concerns over future business feasibility.In the Japanese KOSDAQ market, TG Energy, a manufacturer of broadcasting modules, which the largest shareholder announced the sale of its stake the previous day, and cloud computing company Envix closed at the lower limit side by side. Former CEO So Min-seok, the largest shareholder, replied that he sold Manju among his shares in the market to the Korea Exchange's request for an inquiry disclosure asking why the stock price plunged, and the price limit fell. KSR, which announced that CEO Oh Ga-young, the largest shareholder, and Chairman Kwon Oh-seok, a related party, sold some of its shares in and out of the market this month, also fell to the lower limit during the day and closed lower.Analysts say that the news of the sale of the largest shareholder has become a negative factor in their plunge together. It is explained that the company's permanence is being questioned as the sale of the largest shareholder followed with sluggish performance. TG Energy suffered from operating profit and net profit deficits from last year to last quarter after net profit showed a deficit due to negative annual sales growth. It stopped its navigation business, and its cumulative sales until the quarter were only 100 million won, which is the level of the year.It was also a time when concerns about future business feasibility grew, with sales falling last year due to falling demand.

"Stock prices of companies that sell their largest shareholders' stakes are collapsing. This is due to investors' concerns about corporate stability.Il TG Energy hit the lower limit due to the news of the sale of its largest shareholder's stake and management rights. This is because the news that Cellen, the largest shareholder of TG Energy, sold all of its shares and management rights to HK Properties for KRW 100 million the previous day was a negative factor.Sinozen also ended its four-day decline at the lower limit. This is due to the change of the largest shareholder and the burden of listing additional bonds with the right to acquire new shares.

On the same day, KLNet closed its trading at KRW, down KRW from the previous day.The market's general perception is that the sale of shares by the largest shareholder acts as a negative factor regardless of the volume burden or purpose. This is because the sale of shares by the largest shareholder throws distrust in the corporate management structure as well as anxiety about business permanence.An investor who invested in a company that sold shares of the largest shareholder represented investors' anxiety, saying, ""It's a stock that even people who are recognized as owners throw away, but who can hold it?""A stock market official said, ""The fact that the stake was secretly disclosed after the market ended is evidence that it is a negative factor,"" adding, ""Although there may be differences depending on the acquisition target, the stake sale is rarely carried out in positive situations are positive.""

"Investors are troubled by a series of paid-in capital increase by listed companies. It is positive that there is an opportunity to acquire shares of the company at a low price. However, it is not easy to rush because the paid-in capital increase causes a short-term plunge in stock prices. Stock market experts have called for investment only in companies they know well.According to the Japanese financial investment industry, the KOSPI-listed company Hu Sung is conducting a paid-in capital increase by issuing new shares of Manju to raise operating funds.The expected issuance price per share is about KRW, which is about a discount from KRW, the stock price, on the day of the resolution of the board of directors. The final issuance price is expected to be lower than this, as stock prices have fallen sharply since the resolution to increase the paid-in capital.Fusung is a company established by the chemical business division of Firstek, a defense company, separated by years. It is mainly selling refrigerant for air conditioners, mats for automobiles, semiconductors, and special gas to increase sales. In particular, the refrigerant, which accounts for half of sales, is the only refrigerant produced by Hu Sung in Korea.As the growth of the refrigerant market has slowed down due to environmental pollution and other reasons, Hu Sung has recently produced a key material for secondary batteries in earnest and is growing it as a new growth engine. Last month, it decided to enter the electrolyte market, which is produced by Chemical Technosemochem, by forming a joint venture with a North American material company.The securities industry is paying attention to the new business of Hu Sung. This is because the growth of the secondary battery and material sectors is highlighted as the electric vehicle market expands. If vertical sequencing is carried out from the electrolyte to the electrolyte, Hu Sung is expected to take a leap forward.The performance is also improving. Sales reached 100 million won in the first quarter of this year, up from the same period last year. Operating profit nearly tripled to 100 million won.The subscription date for the general public offering of the company's paid-in capital increase is two days next month.Cha Bio & Co., a KOSDAQ company affiliated with Cha Hospital, is planning to issue new shares. Considering that the planned issuance price is the cause, it is worth 100 million won. After receiving a subscription from shareholders, if the real power occurs, it will be conspired with the general public.Cha Bio& is a company that was listed indirectly on the stock market last year through component maker Dostech. Cha Biotech's bio business has been added to the production of existing Dostech's mobile camera lenses.Although the camera lens sector accounts for a much larger portion of sales, the company's stock price is controlled by the bio business. In particular, expectations are high as the development of blindness treatments using embryonic stem cells currently under development is awaiting clinical approval from the KFDA.Recently, Cha Hospital Group has also attracted attention as an aging complex Chaum, which was established in the middle of Gangnam, Seoul, with KRW 100 million invested. Cha Bio&, which jointly invested in Cha Hospital Group and Chaum, expects to make practical profits in this sector in the future.However, the risk factor is that the perception of stem cell companies is not good due to allegations that a bio company illegally performed adult stem cell treatments that were not approved recently. In fact, Chabio &'s stock price has fallen from the end of last month.In addition, Dasan REITs, a self-managed real estate investment company, is planning to hold a public offering of new shares worth 100 million won next month, while POSCO-affiliated Samjeong P&A has decided to increase its capital by public offering method after allocating 100 million won worth of shareholders.

"Shares of TZ Energy and NVIXX SINOZEN fell wingless due to changes in governance.In the Japanese KOSDAQ market, TZ Energy closed at a price limit of one won. The change in management rights has become a negative factor. TZ Energy announced the previous day that it signed a contract with Sharon, the largest shareholder, and DeProtect, an affiliate, to transfer shares and management rights to HK Properties after the rainy season. The number of shares transferred is Manchuria, and the transfer price is 100 million won.Envix also closed lower at the won. On the same day, Nvix also signed a contract to transfer management rights with Manju, the largest shareholder, to Choi Jung-woo.The sale price is worth billions of won, and the largest shareholder of NVIX will be changed from Jung Ok-jin to Choi Jung-woo.Sinozen fell for the fourth day as it fell to the won on the same day. Analysts say it is due to the change in the largest shareholder and the burden of listing additional bonds with the right to acquire new shares. Sinozen's largest shareholder has now been changed from Kim Sang-eun to Peter Beck & Partner. Peter Beck & Partner, who made a simple investment, became the largest shareholder. Kim Sang-eun, the former largest shareholder, owns the company, and Peter Beck has secured the company.It was also burdensome that the volume of overseas public offering events was additionally listed for two days.

"Due to the Seoul Newsis Park Dae-ro, the number of domestic reporters' disposal of tangible assets has decreased.According to an analysis of the current status of the KOSDAQ market disposal disclosure by the Korea Exchange, the disposal price this year was KRW 100 million, down from KRW 100 million a year earlier. The number of disclosures also decreased from the same period last year.The decrease in the number of cases of disposal of tangible assets is due to the economic recovery. Experts analyze that amid the low-interest rate policy, the financial crunch of companies has eased and concerns over liquidity shortages have been resolved to some extent. As the financial crunch eased, there was no reason for companies to secure liquidity through disposal of tangible assets.In fact, in early last year, when the economy stagnated after the financial crisis, the opposite phenomenon occurred.When the financial crisis broke out in the second half of the year, the financial situation of companies deteriorated rapidly. As a result, the number of cases of disposal of tangible assets to secure financial soundness increased significantly. From last year's month to month, the disposal value of tangible assets was KRW 100 million, up from KRW 100 million a year earlier.Meanwhile, the top companies in the disposal value of tangible assets this year were Grand Department Store, Samaro Pharmaceutical, Handysoft Promserty Seungil, KPF, Hesbon, LS, NVIX, and state-run G&M.

"Conflicts between the current management and the existing auditors are intensifying over the appointment of auditors of NetWave, which is on the verge of delisting due to the release of data from existing auditors. Both sides argue that the other party has put the company in crisis, and are at odds with each other, saying they will also compete for votes at the upcoming shareholders' meeting.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, NetWave management has proposed a bill to dismiss Song Jin-woo, an existing auditor, at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to be held on the coming day. Instead, he recommended Seo Myung-bo, a director of Shinwoo Accounting Corp., as a new auditor.NetWave management claimed that even though the company was on the verge of being kicked out due to the dismissal of the audit, Song's corporate image was tarnished as he filed a series of lawsuits against the company, which led to a sharp drop in stock prices. Accordingly, in order to overcome the current crisis, the company is trying to collect voting rights for shareholders, saying, ""We need to dismiss existing auditors and select new auditors."" NetWave is currently undergoing a delisting review as its largest shareholder has changed at a time when it has been designated as an investor's ventilation item. As a result, stock trading has been suspended since last month.NetWave said it cannot understand the current audit's actions, including a series of lawsuits, and that it wants to increase the company's trust by first recommending independent three signs to break down the situation such as delisting review. He added that the regular shareholders' meeting plans to proceed after the situation is somewhat resolved.On the other hand, the auditor Song's side shows that he did not even give proper data to prevent the company from fulfilling its audit obligations. It is said that the existing management refused to disclose the data to hide the truth, so even the audit work specified under the Commercial Act could not be implemented. In particular, in order to find out exactly what the prosecution is investigating, such as the transfer of management rights, it is working to persuade shareholders that the current audit position should be maintained.An official from Song's side said, ""In order to overcome the company's crisis, we need to conduct a thorough internal audit of the current accounting data, but the situation is not so,"" adding, ""We need to clarify that the case was suspended due to embezzlement or breach of trust."" ""If there is a problem with the company, it should receive penalties and fines for violations of legal punishment or disclosure,"" he said.

"While the Green Cross is soaring due to the news of investment in Innocell, an investor's ventilation company, opinions are divided over the scope of the delisting.This is because companies that are ventilated by investors are automatically subject to a substantial review of delisting when their largest shareholders change, which could rule out the possibility of corporate revival by investing in large companies.According to the Korea Exchange, Innocell decided to raise capital for its student allocation in Manchuria against the Green Cross to raise 100 million won in operating funds. The issue price of new shares is KRW and the payment date is work.On the news, Innocel soared to the won, hitting the upper limit for a consecutive trading day.

However, there are steps to go through here. It is a substantial examination of delisting.

Last month, Erumg & G, an electric vehicle-related shareholder, which was designated as a ventilation item for investors, and Green Technology Investment CoA & I were delisted due to the change of their largest shareholder.In addition, Orient Corporation and NetWave have been given an improvement period due to the change of their largest shareholders, but transactions have been suspended.For this reason, companies designated as investment stocks are urged to ease regulations, saying, ""It is a harsh regulation that takes away opportunities for corporate recovery by receiving investment under favorable conditions.""The head of an investor-ventilated business said, ""Investor-ventilated businesses have difficulty managing their businesses due to many restrictions such as capital procurement,"" adding, ""We don't know what decision the Green Cross will make, but if investment is withheld, it is time to consider easing regulations.""Green Cross said its investment in Innocell will be finalized after a thorough examination of its monthly financial position and technology.

"Korea General Corporation made a public announcement that it will change its name to DH Fashion to enhance its image.This is the first re-change in a year following the change from Enerland Corporation to Korea General Corporation last year.

"On the last day, Dongnam Synthesis announced that it will sell Manju of its subsidiary Korea Pakarizing for 100 million won to Japan Pakarizing. When the news came out, the stock price of Dongnam Synthesis rebounded the next day in a trading day and even jumped to the price limit. This was due to the analysis that profits from the sale of stakes in affiliates will help improve the financial structure of Dongnam Synthesis.When news comes out that listed companies will dispose of their shares in other corporations, such as Dongnam Synthesis, it often acts as a positive factor for stock prices. This is especially true in the case of disposing of shares to raise operating funds or improve the financial structure of a company. This is because we believe that funds will be secured immediately to help companies. However, the disclosure of the disposal of shares of other corporations should not blindly decide on the investment of the company. This is because the disposal of shares in other corporations does not always serve as a boon. After the stock market closed last week, Oh Shopping announced that it would sell its subsidiary stake in Eastern China for 100 million won. The company explained that it will decide to dispose of its shares to secure investment resources for future growth. However, the stock price of Iloh Shopping, the next trading day, fell to the price limit. This is because there were many analyses that the value of the East was too low. Since the announcement of the sale, O Shopping's stock price has fallen until the last day.Samsung Electro-Mechanics and Samsung Card also saw their stock prices fall due to controversy over the sale of their stakes in other corporations.Last month, Samsung Electro-Mechanics announced that it will dispose of all of its shares in Samsung for 100 million won. However, after the announcement, Samsung Electro-Mechanics' stock price has been higher It fell, as experts initially expected the disposal amount to be around 100 million won, but it fell short of expectations.Samsung Card also sold its Everland shares last month for 10,000 won per share. The next day, however, Samsung Card's stock price was higher than the previous day. It fell because the price of Everland shares in Samsung Card's book was 10,000 won, and when it was sold at a price lower than this, controversy arose over the bargain price. Although it was announced that it would sell its stake in other corporations if the disclosure and the actual sale contents change, there are cases where the contents change when the actual sale is made.On last month, the securities industry announced that Korea Polymer will dispose of its stake in its affiliate Daehan General Corporation for 100 million won to secure liquidity. Then, the next day, the stock price of Koryo Foremer rose to the price limit, and the stock price rose further for a consecutive trading day.However, when Koryo Foremer decided to sell its stake in Korea General Corp. last month, the company's stock price fell to a price limit. This is because there have been rumors that the sale of shares in Korea's general trading company will take place less than originally planned in the stock market. In fact, Koryo Polymer announced in a public announcement after the closing of the market that only Manchuria, the level of its original plan, was disposed of due to the transferee's non-payment of the balance. The amount earned through the disposal was only 100 million won.Solomon Savings Bank also announced that it would dispose of all of its shares in Gyeonggi Solomon Savings Bank, which it held last month, for 100 million won. However, the actual disposal amount was 100 million won. Solomon Savings Bank explained that the disposal amount changed when it signed a contract to change the stock trading contract with the buyer.A researcher at a securities firm said, ""We should not make reckless investment decisions because the actual details could change even if we announce that we will dispose of the shares of other companies,"" adding, ""In particular, if the scheduled disposal date is pushed back through a correction notice, we should suspect the disposal amount.""Chosun Biz Hot News: New Israeli Santa Fe Technology Recash in the Sea of Death Is Not Hard to Get a Job at Samsung The half-price wine war E-Mart of Koo's last year without the secret property fight picked by the head of the human resources team has lost."
"Among the management stocks, many of the companies that have recently changed their names in the KOSDAQ market have changed their names, requiring investors to pay attention.According to the Korea Exchange, a total of companies have changed their names in the KOSDAQ market in recent years.CTL Tech, Asia Media Holdings, Sunpack Tech, and Ocean Global were delisted due to their rejection of audit opinions or questions about corporate continuity.Among the companies whose names have been changed, the company is currently designated as a management item.As of this day, the total number of management items in the KOSDAQ market was total, of which the company changed its name in recent years.COS THE H Fashion Orient Prisen Pyeongan Co., Ltd., Orient Precision, Acutech, Bogwang T.S., B&B Sungwon, and The H Fashion Terraum are among the companies that have changed their names in recent years.In the case of COS, a bag manufacturer, the Korea Exchange has already announced on the last day that it meets the criteria for delisting as a result of deliberation by the delisting review committee. This happened only a day after the name was changed and listed in D-Technology.Pyeongan C&T abandoned its name as Ent. last month and changed its nameplate, but if there is no objection after being notified of the accounting firm's rejection of the audit opinion, the delisting process will proceed.Orient Precision Corporation, which filed an objection to delisting on last month, is also one of the companies that changed its nameplate to its current name at Nextech on last month.Securities experts advise that these mission-changing companies are not necessarily bad, but there are often companies that change their names with a feeling of grasping straws, so they need to be careful.Yoo Byung-chul, a reporter for World Finance.

"Until last year, mobile solution company Inspreet had a reputation in the KOSDAQ market thanks to the smartphone craze. However, the crisis began as the insolvency of the subsidiary spread, and the CEO tried to escape by attempting to sell his holdings out of the market. An external accounting firm ruled the audit opinion inappropriate.Then minority shareholders stepped up. Small shareholders appealed to Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Ki-tae, who had ties to the company, to save the company.Minority shareholders made and delivered a pledge earnestly asking former Vice Chairman Lee to participate in management. The former vice chairman Lee's side promised to normalize the company, saying that the request of minority shareholders was too desperate to resist.The former vice chairman immediately received 100 million won. In response, the Korea Exchange said it will delay withdrawal until it confirms its audit opinion on its financial statements in the first half of this year.Like Insprit, there have been a series of cases in which the CEO is responsible for accidents and minority shareholders are responsible for cleaning up the messes. However, unlike the case of Inspirit, most of them fail.A minority shareholder of KOSDAQ company TheH Fashion recently filed a complaint with the prosecution against the company's management. This is because it acquired internal information and sold its stake just before it was designated as a management item.Minority shareholders will work together to normalize their management. However, the stock price plummeted from 1 won to 1 won last month. The damage has already reached an enormous level.Electric vehicle companies have not heard news since CEO Lee Young-ki, the largest shareholder, left the country early last year after saying he would bring money. Minority shareholders seem to suspect that they may have fled overseas.As a result, some shareholders directly pushed for the sale of the company. An official from the securities industry said, ""There have been cases where large companies interested in electric vehicles such as POSCO were forced to take over the company.""There is also a case of picking up companies that have been delisted. Minority shareholders of Hepahov Korea, which was delisted last month, focused on promoting the U.S. subsidiary's artificial liver clinical trial in the U.S. by making and distributing press releases themselves. A minority shareholder said, ""Although it will be difficult to be listed again immediately, we will do our best to revive it."" Another minority shareholder stressed that existing big hands don't know where and what they're doing, but minority shareholders haven't lost hope yet.Most high-ranking government officials lived in Chosun Biz Hot News.

The company says it is a cash investment to expand investment in overseas subsidiaries. Cheongdo Miseong Electronics Co., Ltd. is currently a subsidiary of Miseongpor Tech. We looked at the use of this investment and the outlook for its performance. What kind of item does a Chinese subsidiary manufacture mobile phone parts? They are mass-producing the keypad. The purpose of the investment is. Since the keypad market is so bad, we are considering new businesses. It is planning other items besides the keypad market. It's hard to say any more. The performance of the Chinese subsidiary turned into a deficit last year. The reason is that as I said, I have been producing all the keypad and supplying it to the company. Of course, it is supplied to other companies, but it is insignificant and it can be said that it has been delivered in all of them. But since it's not good enough... What is the forecast for Mi Sung-por Tech's performance this year? This year, the deficit is decreasing. The deficit decreased in the quarter and I don't think I can make a quarter turn. I'm counting. What about the quarter and the quarter? Externally, restructuring and fixed costs have decreased a lot. Because of the cost of this part of the cost reduction. What about the business sector other than restructuring? In terms of business, keypad industry trends are not good in itself.

"I heard a wail from the beginning of the new year. This is the story of the domestic stock market. Everyone is excited about the year of the Black Dragon, which will return in a year, but companies have plummeted to the lower limit in the stock market.The number of companies in the Japanese stock market, the first trading day of the year, fell to the price limit. All of them were KOSDAQ companies.First of all, Pyeongan C&T, which changed its name from NNT, closed the deal at the lower limit on the news that its billion won financing plan failed. Currently, Pyeongan C & T, a management item, has been designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation by the Korea Exchange due to the withdrawal of the paid-in capital increase.MISIFORITECH, which was notified by the court of the commencement of the rehabilitation process and entered its second day of trading, plunged as it was pushed back by profit-taking. MISIFORITECH soared to the upper limit after trading resumed last month.Netwave, whose CEO was accused of breach of trust and lost contact with its largest shareholder, fell to the lower limit for the second day. D-Works Global went straight to the lower limit due to a large-scale order for sale through Kyobo Securities' window.Fortunately, many companies avoided the lower limit, but ended their transactions close to the lower limit.Among listed securities companies, Jinheung Savings Bank and Dongbang Agro's preferred stock, Dongbang Agu Hiteron, plunged more than once.

"Investors are required to pay attention as many listed companies cannot repay their debts even after borrowing money.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, dogs have announced that they have failed to pay the principal and interest of convertible bonds and bonds with underwriting rights this year. Securities-listed companies include Hermes Holdings, Kumho Industrial, Hanil Construction, Namkwang Construction, Daewoo Motor Sales, etc. For KOSDAQ companies, Mijungpor Tech, Nspert, KDC, and others have announced that they have not paid the principal and interest of private bonds.Experts point out that if not only my principal but also interest cannot be repaid to investors, the company's fundamentals are shaking.It is advised that investment in the company should be cautious, saying that it may be difficult even to maintain the listing in the worst case.In fact, Daewoo Motor's sales pushed for a way to split the company into individuals and list it, and the Korea Exchange began the process of reviewing the actual review of delisting. Daewoo Motor Sales announced yesterday that it will divide the company into individuals, including Daewoo Motor Sales, Daewoo Industrial Development, and Daewoo Songdo Development. In the stock market, all three divided companies may fail to be listed again in the worst-case scenario, as Daewoo Motor sales are currently struggling with deficits and corporate rehabilitation procedures are underway.Namkwang Engineering & Construction, which had an operating deficit of KRW 100 million in the quarter, decided to make a reduction in the merger of common shareholders into the same face stock to improve its financial structure.Korea-Japan construction is also suffering from unfavorable factors. Last month, prosecutors raided affiliates of Hanil Cement Group, including Hanil Construction's headquarters, on suspicion of stock trading using undisclosed information. It is known that the stock price soared and made huge profits thanks to the announcement of orders for Libya's large construction shortly after the owner family of Hanil Construction bought a large number of shares in the year.Hermes Holdings is also suffering from chronic poor performance, with its quarterly operating loss of 100 million won.Miseong Fortress Tech, a management item, has maintained its reputation as the application for the commencement of rehabilitation procedures filed with the Incheon District Court on last month was accepted.There is a possibility that large countries suffering from deficits may be kicked out. 　An official from the securities industry said, ""Companies that have expired but do not have funds to pay principal or interest are often facing the worst financial situation,"" adding, ""We should be careful because this could lead to bankruptcy or embezzlement and breach of trust.""

"Obviously, most investors wouldn't even look at the stock if they were asked to buy shares traded at KRW per share in the stock market.At first glance, something difficult to understand is happening in the actual stock market. Some investors acquired shares by paying more than double the amount. Among them, stocks were acquired while looking at losses calculated theoretically.MISIFORITECH, a KOSDAQ company that manufactures mobile phone keypad and parts, announced that 10,000 shares worth of new shares were exercised on the past day. The exercise price of the new stock right was KRW per share.The right to underwrite new shares is a kind of right issued together when a company issues bonds with the right to underwrite new shares, and those who acquire bonds have the right to underwrite new shares in the future through the right to underwrite new shares. At this time, the acquisition price of new shares is set in advance, and this is the exercise price.The exercise of the right to acquire new shares is always the case as companies manage their management activities, but what's curious is that the stock price of Mijungpor Tech is lower than the exercise price. On the day of the exercise of the new stock acquisition right, the closing price of Miseupori Tech was KRW. In other words, the holder of the new stock acquisition right purchased at KRW.B&B members, a manufacturer specializing in stainless steel pipes, are similar. On the same day, B&B Sungwon announced that the right to acquire new shares in Manchuria was exercised. However, the event price per share was higher than the closing price of BNB Sungwon on the day.Electric vehicle-related companies are similar to the above companies, except that the right to claim conversion, not the right to acquire new stocks, was exercised. The right to claim conversion is a right attached to convertible bonds, and bondholders can give up their bonds and convert them into stocks if the company's stock price is likely to rise.When the company converts to stocks, it divides the value per share by the total amount of bonds and pays stocks by that ratio, and the standard price per share is the conversion value. Investors recently issued Manju after exercising their right to claim a conversion worth hundreds of millions of won, saying that if the current stock price is higher than the conversion value, they can convert into stocks and earn profits as much as the difference. The conversion value was KRW at the closing price on the day the right to claim conversion per share was exercised. If this investor bought stocks with 100 million won in cash, he would have owned shares worth twice the size of Manchuria.As such, the company does not know why the current stock price pays a higher price and buys stocks. An official from MISPORITECH said, ""It is true to buy stocks at a higher price than the stock price, but we do not know the reason as it is a matter of individual investors' decision.""Even the hot news of Chosun Biz said, ""The 'Yolk' of smartphones, which were preyed on by patent monsters, is ""Magok"" more than ""Nouga,"" but it's amazing. It's a new concept of ""E-Land Secret"" and ""Box Scaray,"" which made a big hit when companies close their doors."

The main business of Mi-Pori Tech is production of mobile phone keypad, and the keypad industry has begun to be shunned as touch screens have emerged as a trend. The current stock price of Mippori Tech is KRW, which is the level of the initial public offering price.The conspiracy price is a topknot...According to the Korea Exchange, which has fallen in stock prices, the brokerage of newly listed companies has recorded stock prices lower than the initial public offering price among companies listed on the KOSDAQ market in recent years since last year.The reason why brokerage firms' stock prices fall short of the public offering price after listing is that many companies have failed to find new growth engines or regress after failing to keep up with changes in the market. There are also a number of KOSDAQ companies that have succeeded in promising technologies that are suffering from excessive business expansion with funds raised through public offerings or wrong investments.A CEO of a KOSDAQ-listed company said, ""We have entered the KOSDAQ market with success as a venture company, but we see many cases where it is difficult to take a leap forward after listing,"" adding, ""It reveals the limitations of venture managers who are capable of developing and commercializing technologies.""In the case of KOSDAQ companies that do not have a long career, their risk management capabilities will inevitably decrease. In particular, in the case of small and medium-sized companies with more owner management than large companies with a well-equipped professional management system, a moment of error in judgment by the owner may put the company in crisis. A typical case is Aromasoft, which failed to acquire a large affiliate.Some companies are going downhill after listing at the peak of their business conditions. Mysco, which was listed in the year when the forging industry was booming, had a public offering price of 10,000 won, but its stock price is currently KRW. Sales, which stood at 100 million won a year, also fell to 100 million won last year.An official from the securities industry said, ""Companies that failed to be listed on the KOSDAQ will enter the KOSDAQ market based on their good business performance,"" adding, ""However, individual companies' performance may turn downward and be reflected in stock prices.""Due to the nature of the KOSDAQ market, where there are many information technology companies, they sometimes fail to keep up with sensitive market changes. This is an example of a technology that was in the spotlight at the time of listing turning into a specification industry in an instant. In the case of Mijipori Tech, there were high expectations that its performance would increase due to the increase in the supply of mobile phones, but it did not expect the spread of touch screens. Although MISFORITECH entered the touch screen business late in the year, it was not enough. Ice stations and Irivers, which fell as the market shrank due to the advent of smartphones, are also representative examples. It is pointed out that KOSDAQ companies' post-listed strategies are needed in order for the KOSDAQ market to gain investor trust and revitalize only when it is an opportunity for growth, not the final goal of listing.They say that a virtuous cycle should be established in which small and medium-sized KOSDAQ companies grow into mid-sized companies based on their listing and make leap investments as companies that can continue to grow. To this end, measures such as education for KOSDAQ corporate management or support for the introduction of an advanced management system are needed.Byun Joon-ho, head of the small cap team at Eugene Investment & Securities, said, ""In the case of KOSDAQ companies, their ability to manage the crisis is often poor due to their long business performance.""He said, ""It's been a year since the KOSDAQ market was launched, and it's time for solid and sound companies to take over,"" adding that the government and large companies need support measures to increase the number of companies that grow small and medium-sized companies.I'm the owner of a pair of pants, don't touch my baby, don't touch my grandmother's assault, the company's smiling employees are on the verge of soaring securities information today, and I'm on the rise"

"There has been a series of downward revisions to the exercise price of new stock rights by stocks that issued bonds with new stock rights on the KOSDAQ market. The exercise price of the right to buy new shares is usually adjusted on a monthly basis from the date of issuance, but the decline in the exercise price has become inevitable as most stocks have weakened.

In other words, it has increased to nearly 10,000 weeks. Huviron also saw its number of available stocks increase more than 10,000 shares from Manchuria to Manchuria after price.New shares allocated to will someday be put up for sale on the market.

"It is predicted that smartphones with touch screen panels that can feel the touch will be available next year.This is because global smartphone manufacturers such as Nokia are stepping up efforts to develop smart devices that apply tactile sensing. It is also expected that development of contents such as game healthcare using tactile sensing will be active.According to one industry, Nokia plans to jointly develop sense of touch with Finnish venture company Senseg and apply it to smart devices within this year.Senseg is a company that mainly develops sensory interfaces, founded last year by engineers from Nokia. Senseg has recently attracted attention with sense, a tactile feedback technology, and unlike existing haptic products that use vibration motors, it generates tactile signals by modulating electrical forces between fingers. Using this technology, users can feel the texture of the tree as soon as they touch the tree on the display. It is also possible to bend the touch screen in the form of braille.Japanese companies such as Toshibasoni are also focusing on research and development to apply tactile sensing to the next model. Toshiba's Toshiba information system has developed a technology that creates various tactile senses using weak electric field changes. The company recently introduced its technology in a limited way at the Embedded System Development Technology Exhibition. This technology can generate a variety of senses and does not require additional equipment and parts. Another advantage is that it can be applied to various areas such as side and rear of electronic devices.Sony also recently unveiled a mobile phone that uses tactile sensing. The technology is characterized by the elaboration of pressure sensing. You can change the speed of the icon on the screen by adjusting the size of the force that touches the screen. Actuators using piezoelectric materials were separately applied to implement tactile feedback with good feeling. It is known that it is highly likely to be adopted for Sony Ericsson smartphones.Among domestic companies, Mijungpori Tech released a dimensionally high-speed mouse remote control using tactile sensing last month. It is a method of generating signals by recognizing the strength and direction of the user's finger. The company has been promoting commercialization by transferring the original technology of ultra-small mouse and touch screen using tactile sensors from the Korea Institute of Standards and Science.An industry source said, ""While existing haptic products simply transmit vibration, newly developed products are becoming sophisticated by generating various tactile signals on display surfaces,"" adding, ""Tactile sensing will play a key role in implementing next-generation user interfaces.""Reporter Lee Hyung-soo, a collection of well-being electric mats without electromagnetic waves.

"It is true that it is difficult for stock investors to make stock investments hastily now that the KOSPI has fallen sharply from the line to the line in the wake of the economic crisis in major European countries and the U.S. For now, the securities industry is also cautious about making rosy forecasts. On the contrary, investors, who perceived this as an opportunity, are boldly trying to buy stocks.If stock investment cannot be completely abandoned even if the stock market has plummeted, appropriate responses will be needed according to the current situation. First of all, some stock market experts advise that it is better to turn to small and medium-sized stocks for a while instead of large-cap stocks. In addition, there is an opinion that it is necessary to pay attention to the fall and major stocks in the current plunge.Analysts say that the domestic stock market has been shocked by the global economic crisis because it has continued to rise mainly in some large-cap stocks.Baek Hyo-won, a researcher at Solomon Investment & Securities, said, ""In the first half of this year, the domestic stock market suffered a sharp rise due to the global recession caused by the U.S. fiscal debt problem.""It should also be kept in mind that foreign selling will continue for the time being. As the financial crisis of European countries has not been resolved, additional foreign selling is likely to continue. In the end, if foreigners continue to sell, the domestic stock market, which used to rise mainly in large-cap stocks, will inevitably recover slowly.Researcher Baek said, ""It is difficult to actively buy stocks just by thinking about low-priced purchases,"" adding, ""It is time to pay attention to small and medium-sized stocks with institutional buying rather than large-cap stocks, which are the main targets of foreigners.""Of course, in order for small and medium-sized stocks to rise, large-cap stocks must rise. Therefore, there is a possibility that the recent decline in large-cap stocks may limit the increase in small and medium-sized stocks.Researcher Baek, however, said, ""It is difficult to expect foreigners to quickly switch to buying, so we should focus on institutional buying for the time being,"" predicting that access to small and medium-sized stocks, which are somewhat free from global unfavorable factors, will be valid for a while.There is also an opinion that it is time to pay attention to fall and Daeju. Ko Yu-sun, a researcher at Daewoo Securities, said, ""If the market is judged to be oversold, interest in stocks will grow,"" adding, ""It is a way to get good results in the short term for investors betting that stock prices will rebound soon.""However, the fall-out and major investment strategies focused on stock prices are short-term optimization strategies, so it is difficult for investors to take the stocks for more than a few months after purchasing them. Therefore, researcher Ko believes that we should pay attention to falls and major stocks from a fundamental point of view, not stock prices.He said, ""If we invest in a fundamental aspect based on the past, we can take it for a few months or longer as well as short-term,"" adding, ""We need to find and invest in stocks that are high based on historical levels but low due to falling stock prices.""In addition, researcher Koh cited Woongjin Coway, Samsung Techwin, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, Samsung Electronics, Non-life Insurance, Dong-A Pharmaceutical, Seoul Semiconductor, Samsung Heavy Industries, Daum Hana Tour, and others.Stocks that have risen despite a sharp drop in stock prices are bound to rise even in a panic as the stock market plunged. Among the plunge, some stocks recorded a high share price increase rate, the survey showed.According to FnGuide, Mona Lisa is the KOSPI stock with the highest share price increase as of today compared to the last time the KOSPI index maintained its line.Shares of Mona Lisa, which used to be a member, rose to one, rather in the midst of a sharp drop.

Sungji Construction, Daehan Silver Parkji, and KB C&T are also KOSPI stocks whose stock prices have risen more than the same period.Among KOSDAQ stocks, Bogwang TS showed the highest share price increase.

What is the relationship between Tae-seok and Lee Kang-ho, who are eligible for the assignment. I know as an acquaintance of the CEO.

I've had a lot of debt since I started the diamond business. It is difficult to raise funds It's been designated as a ventilation event, so who's going to invest easily? There is also a paid-in capital increase in public offerings in the month. As the stock price fell a lot, there were a lot of complaints. It acquired a stake in LK Media Tech, a broadcasting program production supplier, for 100 million won. It's a video company. Sales decreased too much when the Diamond Chemical division was divided. Therefore, it is intended to acquire this company as a subsidiary and match the profits. Last month, it divided its Diamond Chemical business division. What we acquired was a diamond processing company, and all the company's losses come from here. At first, when the diamond division was merged, it was future-oriented, but it didn't work out well. As gold prices rose, the precious metal market itself died. There are no customers in the gold and silver shop. In the chemical sector, it was also difficult to handle losses even if sales prices were raised as oil prices rose sharply. Solbi Telecom's bad loans also lost 100 million won last year and 100 million won two years ago. That's why we decided to split up. If it continues to go wrong as it is, it will be delisted next year after the management item. I intend to do well and stabilize the company. I put potatoes on the wall. It was a capital erosion crisis if we didn't reduce the capital. The current CEO Choi Kyung-nam was appointed on Monday, and Kim Jae-hyuk, each of them, was also appointed. He was the former largest shareholder of Miju Steel's Next Code and is a professional manager. CEO Kim Jae-hyuk is the largest shareholder of Kim Young-sun. The largest shareholder was changed to Kim Young-sun, a steelmaker in the Americas, last month. He had nothing to do with the company before. I understand that you were vice president of Ewha Electrical Industry. The proportion of the main business and total sales. It's a cell phone connector. It can be seen as a gender seam used to charge a cell phone. I make only the part that connects with the cell phone. It accounts for total sales as of last year. The rest were chemical diamonds. I've been losing a lot of operating profit for years. Connectors are still profitable. There is a huge loss in the diamond and chemical sectors. When it was divided this time, the exchange also admitted that it was not the main division. We will now clean up the two sectors that only suffer losses and become a blue-chip company. Even if it is designated as a management item next year, it will never go to delisting. Therefore, it is planning to strengthen the connector sector. At the same time as debt repayment, it is also pushing to expand facilities. Currently, it is small, but some facilities are ordered.Reporter Lee Jae-Yoo...A popular Korean I-DATCOM article, ""I like Korea,"" and I am wearing an offshore Mercedes-Benz, which was full of interest in handmade sports cars, but I was shocked by a famous comedian and gangster boss"

"This article was released on Monday in Capital Markets Media Money Today.There are views that Cha Investment may be seeking to acquire management rights of KOSDAQ-listed Blue Gem D&C. This is because Cha Investment recently became a major shareholder by participating in Blue Gem D&C's paid-in capital increase.According to the industry, Cha Inbest participated in Blue Gem D&C's paid-in capital increase in student allocation and purchased hundreds of millions of won worth of stocks. As a result, China Invest became a major shareholder after Kim Young-sun, the largest shareholder in the company.Blue Gem D&C's bequest came months after the potato cut last month. The capital, which had decreased from 100 million won to 100 million won at the time of the reduction, was expanded to 100 million won. Its stake in Sungwon Pipe, a major shareholder, has declined from . to .Market officials believe that Cha In-Best participated in the bequest of Blue Gem D&C, an investment ventilation item, to acquire Blue Gem D&C. However, considering the current situation of Blue Gem D&C, it is analyzed that it is difficult for China Invest to inject additional funds in a short period of time.Blue Gem D&C has been designated as an investor's ventilation item by the exchange. In the case of investor ventilation stocks, if the largest shareholder changes, it will be subject to a review of delisting.Initially, Blue Gem D&C is known to have planned a paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million. If China Invest pays the full amount of funds, the largest shareholder will naturally change after the bequest. However, the actual capital increase has been drastically reduced to KRW 100 million, which is the level of the portion.An industry official explained that if Cha Inbest pays all of the 100 million won, it will exceed the stake of Kim Young-sun, the current largest shareholder of BlueGem, and in this case, it will be subject to a substantial review of delisting.The official added that if Blue Gem D&C breaks away from ventilation in the future, there is a possibility that Cha In-Best will increase its stake in Blue Gem D&C by participating in the bequest again.Cha In-best is a new spearhead who completed his first registration last month. It is located in Nonhyeon-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and has a capital of 100 million won. The CEO is Lee Yoon, a former Tong Yang Securities Co., Ltd. Byeon Yang-kyun, former presidential secretary for policy, is listed as an in-house director.Meanwhile, the paid-in capital increase in shareholder allocation, which is being pushed by Blue Gem D&C, is likely to be canceled. This is because related authorities judged that there is a high risk that existing shareholders will invest additional large-scale funds in the form of public offerings in a situation where the company is financially difficult. It is reported that he recently conveyed his intention to the company to refrain from bequest.Private news agency news.

Blue Gem D&C will set the issuance price early and start raising funds when it decides to increase the capital. In particular, the stock price flow after the capital reduction is expected to be a major variable in the success of the capital increase, as potatoes are being made before the capital increase.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Blue Gem D&C will start a paid-in capital increase in Manchuria through a general public offering of forfeited shares after allocating shareholders. The issue price is KRW, and the total amount of recruitment is KRW 100 million. Blue Gem D&C will apply for the allocation of shareholders on Monday and then proceed with the general public offering for forfeited shareholders.Blue Gem D&C will conduct a reduction that mainly integrates shares this month before subscribing to shareholder allocation. The benchmark stock price after the reduction is determined by applying double the closing price the day before the trading is suspended. The first transaction price is formed in a simultaneous call method within the upper and lower limits of this benchmark stock price. Blue Gem D&C's re-listed date is Monday.In particular, in the case of this capital increase, the issuance price has already been confirmed as won.

In other words, there is room for the issuance price to change depending on the flow of stock prices before the subscription date.

Last year, Blue Gem D&C's operating profit was 10,000 won, and its net profit recorded a deficit of 100 million won.

"Stock prices of companies that have survived are mixed. This is the story of KOSDAQ companies that have been lifted from management stocks. They are equally free from the management category and have obtained normal status, but each has a different stock price trend.BTC Information and BTC Information, which are manufacturers of Japan, soared to the price limit for the first day. As of the closing price, the trading volume of BTC Information more than doubled from the previous day as it exceeded Manchuria.BTC Information announced that it was released from the management category as part of the past. This is because the reason for the lack of sales of KRW 100 million, which was originally a problem, was resolved. Sales of BTC Information, which was around 100 million won last year, have recovered to 100 million won this year.Of the KOSDAQ companies that have been lifted from management since the month of this year, all are currently trading. Among them, only BTC Information and GIA Blue have led to a rise in stock prices as news of the departure from management stocks has been a positive factor. Blue Gem D&C and KB C & C fell rather.GI Blue, a railroad track service company that caused the delisting due to the former CEO's alleged embezzlement and breach of trust, was released last month.GI Blue's stock price, which had plunged temporarily since the new benchmark price was calculated and resumed trading after the lifting of the management item, rebounded in a day, hitting the upper limit for two consecutive days as investors flocked from work.On the other hand, Blue Gem D&C, a chemical company, is the opposite. Blue Gem D&C was designated as a management item when one of its creditors filed for bankruptcy, but broke away from the management item as the creditor dropped the lawsuit.Blue Gem D&C's stock price has hardly recovered even though it has been lifted from the management list. Blue Gem D&C's stock price, which began to plunge after the news of the lifting of the management item, fell in half as it plunged for a day.KB C&C, which operates clothing manufacturing and bottled water distribution businesses, suffered a sharp drop after being designated as a management item due to creditors' bankruptcy filing and withdrawal.In response, experts in the securities industry advise that the reason for deviating from the management category should be carefully examined. Similarly, even if it is out of the management category, the reason for the release determines whether the risk remains or whether the risk has been resolved.An official from the KOSDAQ industry said, ""BTC information has recovered sales, which is a visible indicator, and GIP Blue has stimulated investor sentiment as it decided to remain listed,"" but added, ""Blue Gem D&C and KB C&C have no other factors to stimulate stock prices than that creditors have dropped lawsuits.""The official said, ""The experience of stock trading being suspended and companies being designated as management stocks as small creditors filed for bankruptcy could lead to anxiety that the same thing may happen again,"" adding, ""This anxiety acts as an obstacle to stock prices.""""Catch the next generation of nuclear power plants that will stop working if they forget to use a double-edged sword, abuse the response,"" said the Financial Supervisory Service."
"If a major shareholder of a company with a graphic landscape chart is working as an executive of another company, it is right to assume that the two companies are not related if they are only related companies. This is because there is no direct connection between the two companies. But at least not in the stock market.Ehwa Electric Co., a power generator manufacturer, acquired Manju of Blue Gem D&C, a chemical company, for 100 million won last year in the name of Kim, a monthly executive. Kim's stake, which was already owned by Blue Gem D&C at the time, increased to . and Kim became the largest shareholder of Blue Gem D&C.Kim is currently the largest shareholder with a stake in Blue Gem D&C as of last quarter, but officially does not have a title at Blue Gem D&C. Kim's title is still the head of Ewha's sales division. Instead, Ewha Electronics' CEO serves as the CEO of Blue Gem D&C.Ewha Electro-Mechanics says that Blue Gem D&C's CEO and largest shareholder are executives and employees of the company, but this is only a matter of concurrent positions or investment by individual executives and employees and is officially irrelevant to Blue Gem D&C. Blue Gem D&C's name cannot be found on the list of affiliates in the company's quarterly report. An official from Ewha said, ""We did not buy Blue Gem D&C from Ewha.""As of last year, Ewha's stock price is recording less than the won in the KOSDAQ market. Although it is higher than par value, stock prices have been sluggish for months. The case of Blue Gem D&C is even more serious. Blue Gem D&C has hit its lows for the last day in a row. Stock prices have fallen more than enough in the last 10 days.Hyundai P&C, which is engaged in the paint industry in the securities market, has been more directly affected by the sluggishness of its largest shareholder. Hyundai P&C has not recovered its face value since Monday this year. This month ended the week in won per share. Hyundai P&C's largest shareholder is UI Energy, an overseas resource developer on the KOSDAQ.IU Energy has recently been suspended from trading due to rumors of accounting fraud. Although the company denies accounting fraud, the fact that distrust of resource development companies is spreading throughout the market also seems to be a negative factor for UI Energy. Meanwhile, the head of UI Energy serves as the head of Hyundai P&C.An official from the KOSDAQ industry said, ""If news of a company's acquisition of a stake in another company is reported in an unstable business environment, it could cause opposition from shareholders,"" adding, ""For this reason, indirect investment is often made in the name of company executives and employees."" The official also added that even if the company denies it, stock prices often move together.Chosun Biz Hot News Kkokko is going to be a big hit like Korea's overseas expansion.

"KOSDAQ company Blue Gem D&C's paid-in capital increase worth KRW 100 million.

Blue Gem D&C implemented a paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million in third-party allocation for individual investors even after work. The amount of money the company recruited with two capital increase was only 100 million won.Blue Gem D&C, which produces connectors for mobile phones, raised a total of 100 million won in capital increase until this year. Among the paid-in capital increase, the turn was a paid-in capital increase assigned to a third party, mainly by acquaintances of company officials as investors. Some of these investors participated in the capital increase more than once.The reason why Blue Gem D&C focuses on paid-in capital increase in third-party allocation is simple. This is because investors do not flock if capital increase is implemented in the form of a general public offering. In fact, the paid-in capital increase in the general public offering method of forfeited shares has been delayed from the subscription schedule to next year after the allocation of shareholders worth 100 million won, which was announced this month.A Blue Gem D&C official said, ""It is true that it is difficult to raise funds in general because the company is designated as an investor's ventilation item,"" adding, ""We know that some of those who are assigned to third parties are close to the CEO.""Blue Gem D&C has been recording operating losses since year based on its business report. Net loss for the current term has also continued for years. As a result, the company physically divided its diamond and chemical businesses, which suffer a lot of losses last month. Earlier this year, a reduction was carried out to avoid capital erosion.Blue Gem D&C's stock price has continued to soar in line with its paid-in capital increase schedule. Blue Gem D&C has soared for days to days since the past, with the price limit soaring for a day in a row since news of a billion won capital increase was reported.

"KOSDAQ companies are eager to dispose of their poor subsidiaries. Most of the companies' stated purpose of disposing of their subsidiaries' shares is to streamline management through the sale of their shares.

"Stock prices of KOSDAQ-listed companies were clearly divided according to important decisions related to management. Blue Gem D&C decided to split the company and the stock price soared to the upper limit. Woori Pharmaceutical's stock price plunged as it decided to terminate the management transfer contract.Blue Gem D&C announced on the last day that it has decided to split the company into chemical and diamond businesses to strengthen expertise and enhance management efficiency.The company explained that Blue Gem D&C will split its diamond business division to establish a new company, and the company that will be divided will be divided by a simple physical division in which all shares issued by the new company will be acquired. GFI Diamond, which is scheduled to be newly established, will carry out businesses such as diamond and precious metals processing and wholesale and retailing.After the news was announced, Blue Gem D&C soared to the upper limit. First of all, the market seems to positively evaluate Blue Gem D&C's business division. In particular, the decision is expected to serve as an opportunity to raise stock prices, which have been in a slump.Blue Gem D&C showed an unstoppable rise throughout the month with news that Cha Investment will become a major shareholder through participation in a paid-in capital increase. In the month alone, it hit the upper limit for a day in a row, and it soared. However, as a dispute broke out between siblings in the monthly hospital group, Blue Gem D&C also caught fire. As expectations for connection with Cha Hospital were lifted, stock prices went downhill throughout the month and fell close to the month. The acquisition of Woori Pharmaceutical, which has fallen into a swamp due to the cross-border acquisition, has been in pain, with the acquisition subject continuing to change, is on the verge of collapse again. The contract was terminated because the transferee of management rights failed to pay the balance. The crisis of failure to take over was immediately reflected in stock prices. Ilwoori Pharmaceutical plunged more than the previous day, and another transferee, Digital Ocean, also fell more than the previous day.Ilwoori Pharmaceutical announced that it has canceled the contract due to stock transfer and management transfer by failing to pay KRW 100 million in intermediate payments that the transferee was supposed to pay and KRW 100 million in balance that was agreed to escrow to Jinheung Savings Bank. This is not the first time Woori Pharmaceutical has lifted its management contract. The contract was also terminated last month as the buyer failed to keep the contract schedule by depositing only a part of the deposit. The contract, which was canceled this time, was also not smooth, with the subject of the acquisition changed twice.It was scheduled to be sold to individual investors, including Park Woo-heon, who served as CEO of Sammi Industrial Co., last month, but the acquisition body has since changed to Digital Ocean, represented by Kang Moon-seok, the second son of Dong-A Pharmaceutical chairman. And last month, Doctor Holdings was co-acquired by Digital Ocean. As Doctor Holdings became a joint acquisition, the contract amount was changed from KRW 100 million to KRW 100 million, of which KRW 100 million, excluding KRW 100 million that has already been deposited, will be deposited by this month. However, as this amount was not deposited, it eventually led to the cancellation of the contract.A Digital Ocean official said, ""We have already taken over the stake that Digital Ocean should take over, and CEO Kang is the director of Woori Pharmaceutical, so we will also participate in management,"" adding, ""Our Pharmaceutical will find another buyer for the rest.""With the cancellation of the contract, Woori Pharmaceutical will have to start selling its management rights again from scratch.

"After an unprovoked rise in stock prices, a number of companies are deciding on a paid-in capital increase as stock prices rise in the KOSDAQ market.Experts advise that in order to succeed in the paid-in capital increase, companies should be careful about investment as they may intentionally boost stock prices and act as a short-term high point.According to the Korea Exchange, Blue Gem D&C, a chemical and information and communication business, has decided to raise a paid-in capital increase in student allocation worth hundreds of millions of won to raise operating funds. The issuance price of new shares is 100 million won, and the payment date is days.Blue Gem D&C's stock price soared to the won, which rose for nearly 10 days from the previous day.Blue Gem D&C, which is also an investment ventilation item, decided on a paid-in capital increase worth KRW 100 million last month, and at that time, it had a history of jumping from won to won.DBSS, a company specializing in automotive entertainment, has also risen for consecutive trading days, including the upper limit number since the last day. The stock price, which was the original price, soared to the won.As stock prices soared, the Korea Exchange was asked to disclose the reason for the surge in stock prices, and DBS said it is pushing for a paid-in capital increase to raise operating funds.Since then, the stock price has fallen to the price limit and has fallen to its original level.NEPROIT, which has previously been suspended from trading due to embezzlement and breach of trust, also announced a paid-in capital increase a few days after it rose last month.A researcher at SmallCap pointed out that caution is required because the standard date of the paid-in capital increase may serve as a short-term point, saying that companies' stock prices may be intentionally raised before and after the paid-in capital increase to increase the subscription rate.Researcher Lee advised that such companies are likely to have problems such as investment ventilation stocks, and that they should have a habit of carefully considering their performance and corporate value.Reporter Kang Jae-woong said, ""Today's hot news conference, Mobile Korea Forum, pre-booking, was also a necessary murder of a demon who killed just one person My smartphone is a free phone, a mobile carrier, and a colonel who was attacked by one of the dead and wounded in the crash of a high-speed train, eventually...

It disposed of its stake in B&B Sungwon again after disposing of its stake in Miju Steel last month. GIBIO has announced that it will separate its affiliates from Miju Steel and B&B Sungwon, and it can be seen as a sale of shares accordingly. The reason for the separation is. GIABio chose to separate its affiliates to focus on its main business, bio and light-emitting diode businesses, instead of its steel and stainless steel pipe businesses.

"MS Metal B&B Steel Performance Improvement Trend The Bell|This article was released on Capital Market Media Money Today on Monday.B&B Sungwon has a solid sales structure and excellent technology. Although each of these companies is building a different business model, they continue to cooperate with each other through a common denominator of the steel business.Last year, subsidiaries' performance was not good due to the poor business conditions. It was not easy to expect synergy between affiliates. However, as the market has been recovering since the beginning of this year, sales and operating profit are gradually improving.B&B Sungwon has set a goal of maximizing synergy through business exchanges with affiliates such as MS Metal, a steel-specialized distribution company, and B&B Steel, a high value-added steel pipe manufacturer. Securing stable purchasing accounts of MS Metal...Sales increase expectations MS Metal is a steel distributor owned by B&B Sungwon. Unbounded wooden steel pipes made of stainless steel and carbon steel are distributed to domestic shipbuilders. Stainless steel-free wooden steel pipes, which account for the total sales, are known to be high value-added products that are more than twice as expensive as regular carbon steel pipes.MS Metal's biggest strength is its sourcing ability to deliver products that consumers want in a timely manner. In particular, it has excellent sourcing ability in the offshore plant sector, securing a number of shipbuilders as customers.MS Metal's domestic suppliers are supplying welding steel from its parent company B&B Sungwon and Metal Seas Steel.Overseas buyers are more diverse. Japan is interacting with companies around the world, including Italy, Spain, and Sweden.In particular, Japan's Kobe Steel signed an exclusive sales agreement in Korea. Accordingly, if domestic companies want to purchase Kobe Steel's products, they can only receive them through MS Metal.MS Metal is registered as a vendor of Korea's leading shipbuilders and carries out direct transactions. Major clients include Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, Samsung Heavy Industries, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering. Overseas exports are centered on Japan and Southeast Asian countries.MS Metal's performance fell sharply last year due to the sluggish domestic shipbuilding economy. It recorded only sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won. However, as the market has gradually stabilized recently, performance has been improving. The company expects to record sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won this year.An official from SM Metal said, ""We plan to accelerate the development of markets in the Seoul metropolitan area through the newly established Gyeongin sales team last year and increase the proportion of overseas exports."" Collaboration with B&B Steel POSCO...B&B Steel, which strengthens its parent-child company's network, is a rental company with high-strength steel pipes. MS Metal, Miju Steel, and B&B Sungwon hold stakes.POSCO has developed and released a high-strength steel pipe brace using high-strength steel materials under the name. B&B Steel integrated its brand with POSCO last month after holding a joint brand agreement with POSCO for high-strength steel pipes. The high-strength steel pipe support beam can reduce the maximum amount of abnormal steel compared to the shape steel. It is known that construction costs can be reduced by close because it has an air-shortening effect.B&B Steel is in charge of construction and leasing after signing a technology transfer contract for high-strength steel pipe support with Pohang Industrial Science Research Institute under POSCO. POSCO is supplying coils for high-strength steel pipes and requesting production from its affiliated company, Miju Steel. The main construction sites of Ganggwan Bertimbo include the construction of the underground road in Cheongna District, the construction of the underground road in Nambu Circulation Road, the construction of the new Busan Centum Square, and the expansion of the Dongbu Expressway.The company aims to achieve sales of 100 million won this year. Compared to last year's 100 million won, this year. As it has recently entered the steel pipe business for rent, it is inevitable that operating losses will occur slightly due to depreciation costs for the time being.B&B Steel is currently seeking to establish a plant in Gwangyang City. It plans to produce steel pipes, bracelets, and spiral steel pipes here. Through this, it is planning to accelerate its entry into overseas markets.An official of B&B Steel said, ""We will be able to make a leap from a high-strength steel pipe brace rental company to a company that produces steel pipe files and thick pipes,"" adding, ""We will also be able to reduce logistics costs as it is close to Suncheon plant of B&B Sungwon.""B&B Sungwon plans to make all-out efforts to strengthen its network between parent and child companies from the second half of the year as its affiliates' performance has recently improved and business models are diversifying. It plans to maximize synergy in the steel business by continuing its cooperation with B&B Steel, which is entering the high-value-added steel pipe manufacturing industry of MS Metal, a steel distribution company and a leading company in the domestic steel pipe file industry.Kim Chung-geun, CEO of B&B Sung-won, said, ""Cooperation between affiliates is in full swing over the steel business and the results will be shown this year,"" adding, ""We will be reborn as a B&B member that can meet market demand and meet shareholder expectations.""

"B&B Sungwon announced that CEO Kim Choong-geun will resign at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to be held on the coming day and appoint Yoon Hae-kwan, CEO of Miju Steel, as the new CEO.The extraordinary shareholders' meeting, which was scheduled to be held on Monday at the request of major shareholders, has been postponed to Monday at the request of representative Yoon Hae-kwan. CEO Yoon is known to have decided to take control of B&B Sungwon's management rights considering the business synergy between Mijoo Steel and B&B Sungwon.An official of B&B said, ""Yoon is the son of the late General Yoon Pil-yong, who was a heavyweight during the Park Chung-hee administration, and he will contribute greatly to expanding his operations with POSCO and other related companies."" For reasons of CEO Yoon's background, the stock market classifies Miju Steel as Park Geun Hye-related stocks.The official expected that Kim Mu-gi, known as a candidate for outside directors at the shareholders' meeting, will also give a big boost to stabilizing the company's management and developing sales channels at home and abroad.

"This article was released on Monday in Capital Markets Media Money Today.B&B Sungwon, a stainless steel pipe manufacturer, is expected to be reorganized into a form directly managed by its parent company Miju Steel under CEO Kim Choong-geun.B&B Sungwon will hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Monday and pass a bill to appoint a nominal in-house director, including Yoon Hae-kwan, CEO of Miju Steel, and former vice president of Dongbu Securities Kim Mu-ki as directors. CEO Kim Chung-geun is expected to step down as CEO and focus only on B&B Sungwon's overseas operations.The reason why B&B Sungwon is switching to Yoon Hae-kwan's representative system is known to maximize synergy between mother and child companies. In particular, close cooperation between the two companies is expected to have a positive impact on future national projects.B&B Sungwon is drawing much attention in the market due to favorable factors at home and abroad, such as a contract to explore gas fields near Dokdo, development of Surville gas fields in Uzbekistan, and an agreement to form a North Korean gas pipeline operator committee.B&B Sungwon's performance has been improving recently. Profitability is also improving by recording operating profit of KRW 100 million in the first half of the year.Yoon Hae-kwan, who will be appointed as an in-house director of B&B Sungwon, is currently the CEO of Miju Steel. He is famous as the son of the late General Yoon Pil-yong, who was a heavyweight during the Park Chung-hee administration. He is known to have strong connections with influential figures of the Park Chung-hee administration. For this reason, the securities industry sees Miju Steel and B&B Sungwon, which are managed by CEO Yoon Hae-kwan, as beneficiaries of Park Geun Hye.Oh Se-hoon, a dream basket full of happiness, is burning.

The Korea National Oil Corporation will begin drilling in the East Sea mine area with the delivery of a drill ship made by Hyundai Heavy Industries.I talked with a B&B member official. There is an evaluation that it will benefit from the development of the Dokdo gas field. If that happens, we expect to benefit as well. The scale itself is difficult to judge due to its detailed relationship. The reason why B&B members will benefit is. We developed the deflex steel. For the first time in the stainless business, we succeeded in the development stage like POSCO and are developing other products. Can product development alone benefit? In the case of regular steel pipes, the point of corrosion is fast. However, the diplex steel we developed is salt-resistant. Because of this specificity, it can be used efficiently in the sea. Our company is the only company that can do that. When do you expect the specific steps to take place? It is not yet in the stage of putting in orders. It is early to determine how much the quantity will be and how much it will affect. If drilling starts and starts, specific volume or sales will be expected. How is this year's performance? Its performance was about 100 million won in operating profit for the first half of the year. It will be better in the second half. Last year was hard because it was branded as a bad company in the second half of the year, but it was completely resolved from this year. Current financial position.

"When I opened the wind from the steel pipe on the Siberian gas pipe, a gas pipe from Siberia comes to South Korea via North Korea.It's a huge plan just to imagine. However, investors seem to think that they will come. This is the case when the so-called Kim Jong-il-themed stock price moves.The reason why Kim Jong-il's theme stock was formed is that while North Korean leader Kim Jong-il visited Russia, news broke that Russia was pushing to build a gas pipeline. Through this, Russia sells gas to South Korea and gives commissions to North Korea.Last month, the theme stock of the steel pipe went straight to the upper limit. This is due to expectations that a huge amount of steel pipes will be supplied to pipelines that are expected to reach. The main characters are Mi-Joo Steel and Dongyang Steel, B&B Sungwon and High Steel. Since then, stock prices have moved in a similar manner and have fluctuated together.If this mega-project is completed, both companies and investors will be happy. But will the project become a reality? If it becomes a reality, will they be able to benefit?It is an early question to answer, but similar answers can be found at least based on their current production capacity and the current status of the domestic steel market. Unfortunately, it's more of a no.Dongyang Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. and Sungwon Pipe Co., Ltd., which changed their names to B&B members, are all companies with a long history and technology. However, the products they produce cannot be used as long-distance pipelines.The main focus of the American steel and Oriental steel pipes is spiral steel pipes. In particular, Miju Steel generated nearly half of last year's total sales of spiral steel pipes.Spiral steel pipes are steel pipes made by twisting and welding iron plates in a twisted shape. Instead of being able to make it as long as you want, you have a weak ability to withstand pressure. The only use of steel pipe piles to strengthen the weak ground during large civil engineering works is the steel pipe piles.In order to withstand the intense cold in Siberia and to withstand ultra-high pressure in the deep sea, the highest-quality product among special products, oil well pipes, is needed. There is a big difference in the level of manufacturing technology from spiral steel pipes.A thick tube with a thick wall is used as an oil well steel pipe, which has a different pedigree from that of ordinary steel pipes.Steel pipes are usually made by rolling steel plates with small rolls and electrical welding. On the other hand, thick tubes cannot be manufactured with existing facilities because thick thick thick plates must be bent. It is made by hitting it with a high pressure press or bending it with a large roll and then special welding. Not only does it require strong equipment, but the manufacturing time per unit is much longer.Miju Steel and High Steel also have some thick tube facilities. However, the processing capacity is limited to the thickness that can be used for shipbuilding and offshore plants. The products of Steel Flower and Aju Best Steel, which are the manufacturers of thick tubes in Korea, are also not available for large-caliber pipelines.Yoo Seung-rok, a senior researcher at POSRI, said, ""Yoo Jeong-yong's steel pipes are completely different in material and welding technology from structural pipes and construction pipes,"" adding, ""In order to manufacture them, it is necessary to invest in facilities.""B&B Sung-won, which is also hitting the upper limit together, has no connection with the pipeline. B&B Sungwon is the top of stainless steel pipe in Korea. Stainless steel pipes are expensive products mainly used for water pipes in buildings.It is impossible to use stainless steel pipes in oil pipelines from Siberia to North Korea to South Korea. Because it is expensive. Production capacity is also far from sufficient. There is no place to buy ingredients. Even if the gas pipeline project is completed, it is difficult to expect benefits.For the above reasons, the steel industry agrees that the so-called beneficiary of Kim Jong-il has no substance. An official from a steel company said, ""The real beneficiary of steel pipe companies, which are mentioned as beneficiaries, is the construction industry,"" adding, ""It was much more natural when their stock prices were fluctuating in the rough project.""It is not possible to discuss all the steel pipe markets over the uncertainty of the benefits of Big Island such as Seah Steel, and the B&B members of the Oriental Steel Corporation. This is because most of the domestic steel pipe market is actually occupied by Seah Steel and Hyundai Hysco Hustel. It is the so-called Kim Jong-il theme stocks that have divided the rest.Big has much higher production capacity and its product spectrum is incomparable to that of small and medium-sized steel pipe companies. In particular, steelmakers have a high rate of securing raw materials for POSCO, a matter of life and death.So are they the beneficiaries? Interestingly, the benefits of large steel pipe companies are also limited. This is because there is also a limit to making steel pipes for large pipelines.The East Sea Gas Pipeline Project is actually not new to steel pipe manufacturers. Kim Dae Jung This is because during the government, the gas pipeline construction project from Siberia to the Korean Peninsula through the East Sea was already carried out.The discussion was more specific at the time. Biggar has come up with an innovative plan to overcome the lack of large oil pipeline manufacturing technology. The plan was to build a steel pipe plant for oil wells through joint investments.Specific investment amounts have also been released. It was a considerable amount for Hustel, which has annual sales of about 100 million won per company, as well as Seah Steel and Hyundai Hysco.At that time, the project was not completed and Big's joint project was buried.An industry source said, ""Even if the project is completed, it is highly likely to import products from Europe if it does not have a batch production capacity in Korea,"" adding, ""If the current situation is the case, it will only benefit from Big's winning of the branch from the main pipe.""The securities industry is also distrusting the so-called Kim Jong Il theme stock. A securities firm researcher, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ""How likely is it to succeed in cooperating with North Korea, where the situation is unstable?"" and added, ""I wonder how many investors now believe in the project.""He added that investors who want to gain profits by jumping on the psychology without confirming the exact possibility of benefiting are likely to lose money.

"GIA Bio, a KOSDAQ-listed company, decided to sell its grandchild's shares but canceled them. It is pointed out that this is to avoid loss of equity method.According to the Japanese securities industry, G.I.Bio announced on the last month that it would terminate the stock transfer contract with Miju Steel. GIBIO has decided to hand over Manjoo, a subsidiary of Miju Steel, to Miju Steel for 100 million won.It is possible to break the transfer agreement. The problem is that Miju Steel was a subsidiary of GIA Bio at the time. At that time, G.I.Bio was the largest shareholder with a stake in Miju Steel. He tried to hand over his stake in his grandson's company to his subsidiary, but stopped.Nevis Stock, a research company specializing in small and medium-sized stocks, pointed out in a daily report that there are circumstances of support among affiliates that risk damage to corporate value in such equity transactions. The start of the incident was that GI Bio participated in a paid-in capital increase of its grandson, B&B Sungwon, last month. At that time, GIBIO acquired B&B Sungwon's new stock market Manchuria at a higher face value than the standard stock price. In other words, G.I.Bio participated in the paid-in capital increase with a loss of about KRW 100 million.A month later, G.I.Bio announced that it would sell the stake to American Steel after receiving KRW 100 million, but canceled it.Nevis Stock's analysis is that such a transaction is based on the intention to transfer the loss of the equity method from the acquisition of shares of BNB Sungwon to US Steel. Miju Steel suffered a loss of KRW 100 million in the equity method last year on its stake in B&B Sungwon, including its stake held by GI Bio through a stock purchase contract.an old reporterSuccessful Habits Prohibiting Unauthorized Reproduction and Redistribution of Korean Economic Newspapers Copyright in accordance with the Korea Online Newspaper Association's Digital News Usage Rules"

As a result, the largest shareholder of Miju Steel was changed from GIA Bio to Geoyang.The securities industry analyzes that GIA Bio is trying to change its governance structure leading to B&B members of Miju Steel in the wake of the sale of its stake in Miju Steel. This means that it will separate its affiliates through the sale of its holdings and then switch to an independent management system for each company.This structure has already been decided in the second half of last year.

"Related stocks are fluctuating as North Korean leader Kim Jong-il is known to have expressed his intention to allow gas pipelines from Russia to South Korea to pass through North Korea.As of 1 a.m., BNB Sungwon, Mi-Joo Steel and Dongyang Steel Co., Ltd. are on the rise. These stocks are considered theme stocks related to Russian gas pipes in the stock market.Demand for pipe joints is also expected to increase due to the development of liquefaction plants and storage, and buying is flowing in as the benefits of Sungkwang Bend Taekwang are also expected.Pipe-related stocks soared to the upper limit with the news of Chairman Kim's visit to Russia on the last day, but returned the rise in just four days. Analysts say the project will not be smooth in light of the recent strained inter-Korean relations.The upward trend seems to improve investor sentiment as Chairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim expressed his exact intention to North Korea.According to Viktor Ishayev, former president of the Russian Far East Federal District, Kim said that if South Korea and Russia sign a natural gas supply agreement, North Korea is ready to provide territory for the construction of a gas pipeline.In addition, news that Daewoo International and Energy will participate in the development of the domestic continental shelf is also affecting. On the same day, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy held an undersea mineral resource development council to grant Daewoo Inter and Energy the right to explore the central and southern regions of the Korean continental shelf mine.Until now, the surge in stock prices of these companies has been the biggest impact on the introduction of Russian gas in Korea and news of exploration of the continental shelf.However, experts point out that it is necessary to analyze the fundamentals of these companies. It is necessary to pay attention to the approach simply because it is a theme stock without practical support. According to the survey, these companies have gas pipeline-related technologies.Last month, B&B completed the vendor registration of a subsidiary of Iran's state-run oil company and signed a contract to supply about 100 million won worth of stainless steel pipes.Miju Steel manufactures and sells thick steel pipe products used in natural gas pipelines. It posted sales of 100 million won last year. Oriental Steel Co., Ltd. was recognized by the National Oil Association and signed a pipe supply contract with the Korea Gas Corporation.Experts predict that these companies have gas pipeline-related technologies, but many difficulties are expected until detailed discussions are made, and it will take a lot of time for actual sales to occur.At the time of the gas supply discussion with Russia in the year, the planned introduction was in the year. The pipeline was scheduled to be built in the year, but discussions had been suspended due to worsening inter-Korean relations. Even if we start discussing positively again, the actual sales will be in a few years.In particular, the reason is that the stock prices of these companies returned to their original positions after soaring. Dongyang Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. and B&B Sung-won Co., Ltd. saw their stock prices soar close to the level of monthly highs after signing a memorandum of understanding between Korea and Russia in October. It was about half of what it was just before the contract was signed.Securities experts said that trust between the two Koreas is needed for the specific project to be carried out, adding that news on gas pipes may be positive for stock prices, but it is likely to be at a short-term level.Real-time News Money Today No Unauthorized Reproduction or Redistribution of Kim Gun-woo, a Dream Basket Full of Happiness"

The largest shareholder of Mi-Joo Steel was changed to Geoyang by selling its shares in Mi-Joo Steel in the market last month.GIBIO previously sold Manju of B&B Sungwon's stock to Miju Steel, which was held monthly last year, but the sale contract was canceled because B&B Sungwon failed to pay for the stock acquisition. The volume that could not be disposed of at the time was released to the market this time.B&B Sungwon's stock price has fallen since this month, falling to its original level once a month, but its stock price has soared since Monday as it was classified as a Park Geun Hye theme stock with rumors that CEO Yoon Hae-kwan was the son of General Yoon Pil-yong, a close aide to former President Park Chung-hee.In addition, after North Korean leader Kim Jong-il visited Russia, rumors spread that he was the beneficiary of the inter-Korean gas pipeline project, and stock price volatility expanded. After the month, stock prices have risen to .However, as GIA Bio's stock sale is announced, it is excluded from the so-called theme. Unlike the high-steel Oriental Steel Co., Ltd. with the upper limit, B&B support fell.The case of major shareholders selling their stakes on the theme stock craze appears repeatedly in the stock market.Choi Jang-ho, CEO of Cheonmyung Development, who rose to be a major shareholder of the company by buying Boryeong Mediance at the beginning of the year, sold his shares after Boryeong Mediance was tied to Park Geun Hye theme stocks.Likewise, MetaBiomed, which was classified as a welfare-themed stock for the elderly and whose stock price has soared since the month, was sold by CEO Oh Seok-song. MetaBiomed once rose to its original level at the beginning of the month, but it recently weakened and closed the won on the same day.An official from the securities industry said, ""If the stock price rises sharply due to theme stocks, it will inevitably be swayed by the temptation to sell,"" adding, ""If the stock price rises in large quantities, investors will have to pay attention.""

"This information is provided by a pre-emptive attack on Run Securities Broadcasting.I'm looking for a technique. There are so-called super ants in the stock market.They are working with the attention of numerous ant investors through various lectures and Internet broadcasting. What is the secret to success of these super ants, who can give advice on stock investment to others, surprisingly, you can easily infer the answer. The biggest concern of individual investors looking for stock investment success stories or famous analysts is the transfer of techniques. If I know their techniques, I fall under the illusion that I can succeed. According to the pre-emptive strike, known as the pioneer of super ants, the single principle trade is more important than the branch technique.There are countless paths to the destination of success. As such, the stock trading technique means that there are many differences. In other words, it doesn't matter which way people who succeeded in stocks went. What they have in common is not which way they went, but that they have consistently followed the principle and walked only one path.Under firm principles, consistent stock investment has been made with the right trading habits. Individual investors who do not know this advantage often waste time and energy looking everywhere to learn techniques. It must be kept in mind that techniques shine only when they are based on principles.The preemptive strike by analysts, dubbed the stock shaman, is leading the way to successful full-time investors by correcting the illusion of individual investors and suggesting ways to set and adhere to their own principles rather than techniques.

This is because the change of the CEO was announced within the day after the response to the inquiry disclosure related to significant market fluctuations.

"Investors' attention is required as there is a possibility that A1 Micro will be listed on a large volume of more than 10,000 shares.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Manju of Il A-One Micro shares will be listed as the exercise of the right to hold bonds with the right to acquire new shares.However, the problem is that the amount of stocks that can be additionally listed at any time is Manchuria, which accounts for the current total. Currently, in addition to the daily listed volume, the balance remains in Manchuria, Manchuria, and Manchuria.The current total number of issued shares of A1 Micro is Manchuria, which becomes Manchuria when all currently available stocks are listed.Concerns about dilution of stock prices are inevitable.In addition, it is analyzed that it can be released to the market at any time, considering that the current stock price is KRW with a total event price of KRW. A-One Micro's stock price has soared, including the upper limit number on the recent trading day.Meanwhile, on the same day, A1 Micro announced that a lawsuit was filed by Jung Seok-woo to invalidate the issuance of new shares. The claim is about Manchuria issued by A1 Micro last month.

"In addition to applying for an injunction to issue new shares with the intention of obstructing the project, One Micro announced that a lawsuit was filed by Jung Seok-woo to invalidate the issuance of new shares. The claim is about Manchuria issued by A1 Micro last month. The stock, which was scheduled to be listed on the list due to the lawsuit, has been postponed indefinitely.On the same day, A1 Microw announced the exercise of rights to the total shares of bonds with the right to acquire new shares. The event amount is KRW, and the listing date is days.An executive of A1 Micro said, ""We are preparing to apply for an injunction to issue new shares, so there will be no problem in progress,"" adding, ""We are aiming for total sales this year by adding 100 million won in sales in the second half of the year.""Last year's sales and operating losses of A1Micro recorded 100 million won and 100 million won, respectively. Net loss of sales and operating losses in the first half of this year was estimated at 100 million won to 100 million won, respectively. Who is Jung Seok-woo who filed the lawsuit? The reason for the lawsuit is. He is currently a registered director and is on standby. He will be dismissed through this shareholders' meeting. I don't know the reason for the lawsuit. I can't even get in touch at the moment. I think it is intended to make the company's business difficult. Does Jung Seok-woo have a stake? Or it won't be a case. There used to be no week. Well, I could have bought it for a few weeks. It is only now under review after receiving a complaint. It's the content. Anyway, I'm planning to apply for an injunction to issue new shares. Is the issuance schedule of new shares continuously delayed? I don't think we can do it right now. However, these shareholders are not so urgent. Of course it's gonna be a hassle, but... Even if it is possible to exercise immediately, the balance of Manchuria, Manchuria, Manchuria, and Manchuria remains over 10,000 weeks. Perhaps it will continue to exercise warrent. However, they are not sold immediately because they are listed, but they are those who will take them in the long run. They are long-term investors that management is familiar with. If all are listed, it will be about 10,000 shares, but the stock value will be diluted. That is not the point. Currently, management stocks are protected for years and there are years left. Protection Jesus is common for about years, and he did so in order to show confidence or commitment to management. The new business is about renewable energy. How do you expect this year's performance? This year's sales target is 100 million won, and existing display facilities are expecting about 100 million won from new businesses. As it passed the crisis of mutual closure in the month, existing display businesses resumed operations from the month. Despite the very difficult business conditions, it made sales of KRW 100 million in the first half of the year. Of course, the second half will be better than the first half. Last year's sales are 100 million won, but if the new business is 100 million won, isn't it very big? Are there any specific issues? It is difficult to specify the details because it is currently in the state of being signed. I'll make it official after the shareholders' meeting. As far as I know, there are still a lot of fans. It's over. That's only calculated in the first half. That is absolutely not the case given the second half. New orders in the existing business sector are active, which can sufficiently normalize performance. In addition, new business sales will come right from the quarter in the new business sector. It is actually the lower limit number at the upper limit of the recent trading day. Some say that there are operational forces. The volume of transactions has also increased significantly compared to the previous one. They have no idea about compensation for the former shareholders or the influx of operational forces. Today's upper limit is seen as a rebound due to the inability to issue new shares. There is no such thing as a strategy. In fact, it is not helpful for stock prices to rise this way. As you can see from the announcement of the shareholders' meeting on Monday, I think expectations for the change in management and the addition of new businesses have been a positive factor. New funding is also expected.Reporter Lee Jae-Yoo...Korea's I-DATCOM Popularity Article: The difference between organic milk shock and the world's best technology, Korea, Korea, and Joseon, is so terrible.

"Despite the upward trend, one of the KOSDAQ stocks that hit the lower limit was found to be a ventilation item for investors selected by the exchange.The total number of stocks that hit the lower limit based on the closing price was counted as individuals and KOSDAQ stocks were counted as individuals. Most of them, Gaesa, are the ventilation items of exchange-designated investors. Among the stocks that fell to the lower limit during the day and barely avoided the closing of the lower limit by reducing the drop, there are many cautionary ventilation stocks.On last month, the exchange designated the opening of a company that is financially insolvent or requires attention to management transparency as an item of investor interest. This is to convey a kind of signal to investors about stocks of interest.The exchange's intention is realized to some extent as the caution ventilation stocks fill one of the list of companies with the lower limit on the day, the first trading day after the designation of the caution ventilation stocks.Although it hit the lower limit on the day, stocks that are not cautionary ventilation items are Mirinet and A1 Micro Clean & Science Win Technet.Mirinet closed the market with its stock price falling to the lower limit of . . as news of a paid-in capital increase worth 100 million won was reported. A1 Micro could not avoid the lower limit as news of stock-related bond issuance spread in the market. The market closed at a loss compared to the previous day.Most of the caution ventilation stocks are analyzed to have been greatly affected by various internal and external conditions as well as the aftermath of the designation of ventilation stocks.Compared to the previous day, investors turned their backs on the recent legal battle among shareholders over the designation of ventilation stocks in the state as well as the CEO position.Nextech, which had been constantly raising concerns over insolvency due to a series of financing, also hit the lower limit on the day. The recently announced sluggish performance last year also served as a negative factor.An official at the Korea Exchange said, ""Most of the companies that hit the lower limit on the day are insolvent companies with stock prices falling below the won per share,"" adding, ""We hope that this week's designation of ventilation stocks will stimulate investor sentiment to buy miscellaneous stocks in a speculative manner.""However, some companies have been shackled by the state's ventilation stocks.

"On the afternoon of the last day, due to the deterioration of the financial structure, the company withdrew from the company due to the recovery of sales of micro-robots due to the KOSDAQ's opening and closing review. On the floor of the Korea Exchange in Yeouido, members of the substantive review committee for delisting sat down. In their hands, they held management improvement plans submitted by two companies, Micro Robot and Kyungyoon Hydro Energy.The fate of the two companies was divided after a heated discussion of a total of hours and a half per company. While micro-robot succeeded in maintaining its listing, Kyungyoon Hydro Energy has been decided to exit the market.What are the criteria for determining the fate of these two companies?Although it is difficult to clearly distinguish the boundaries, it is analyzed that the will to revive and how thoroughly a management improvement plan is established to support it are life and death.The reason why micro-robots are on the list for de-listing is that sales have plummeted due to the rapid economic recession.As sales fell to less than KRW 100 million last year when the global financial crisis broke out, the company, which was selected as a management item, is likely to be delisted as it failed to exceed KRW 100 million in sales last year.Although he seemed to be taking a breather as he barely exceeded 100 million won in sales, he did not give up the suspicion that he might have artificially generated temporary sales to avoid eviction of the judges.As a result, the review committee held two more meetings last year, but postponed the final decision.Sales showed little signs of improvement due to the absence of core businesses and the governance structure was unstable, but there were many opinions to wait and see in anticipation of venture companies pioneering a new market of robot business.In particular, the merger with equipment manufacturer A1Meka last month helped change the mood of the listing committee.Accordingly, the listing committee decided to decide whether to stay or leave after seeing last year's audit report that contained changes after the merger. This is to check how strong the sales structure has become.Min Kyung-wook, head of the Korea Exchange's corporate analysis team, said, ""The listing committee wanted to see the company's audit report during the settlement period,"" adding, ""We were able to confirm that the reason for the delisting was resolved.""Lee Il-hyung, head of the micro-robot finance team, explained, ""We tried to meet the standards required by the exchange, such as whether it could generate sales through normal operations or whether transparency in management is guaranteed.""Last year, the company continued to go into the red with operating losses of 100 million won, but its sales increased to 100 million won.After such hard work, micro-robots were excluded from the delisting list, and trading resumed in 10,000 years.On the other hand, Kyungyoon Hydro Energy, which was put on the review board for delisting due to embezzlement by its executives and employees, was eventually declared out of the market.Kyungyoon Hydro was driven into a crisis of mutual aid after a billion won embezzlement case involving all employees broke out late last year.The company underwent a substantial review of delisting earlier this year, but the decision was postponed once as the company submitted an objection.Although it was late, efforts to revive the company have also been made since early this year. It also appointed a new manager and announced a supply contract worth 100 million won with Byeoksan Construction. In addition, the government also decided to make major capital cuts to improve its financial structure.However, the listing committee agreed that it is not easy to maintain the company with this much effort.Team leader Min explained, ""First of all, there was an embezzlement problem and the delisting was decided because it fell short of the standards in comprehensive evaluation of financial structure, governance, and business capabilities.""Reflecting this, Kyungyoon Hydro Energy's audit report last year pointed out uncertainties in continuing companies as a reference.According to the report, the company's operating loss reached KRW 100 million last year and net loss reached KRW 100 million for the current period. In particular, it was pointed out that the possibility of additional insolvency cannot be ruled out as it is in charge of guaranteeing payment of KRW 100 million for loans from Samwoo, a related party undergoing corporate improvement work.In a related development, Dongseo Accounting Corp., an external auditor of the company, assessed that there is uncertainty that raises questions about Kyungyoon Hydro's ability to survive as a continuing company.Meanwhile, Kyungyoon Hydro will be delisted after a clearance sale period from this coming day to next month.

"Apro Technology, which produces Apro Technology issuance promotion, is pushing for golden issuance.

However, since gold does not change the price of the event, a higher proportion of potatoes is likely to make a big profit.Ilapro Technology said that even if the company, which is issued by a special resolution at the shareholders' meeting, reduces the price of the event, the price of the event will not be raised. Currently, the price of the event, which is scheduled to issue hundreds of millions of won worth of tickets, is around KRW per share.If Apro Technology succeeds in passing the large reduction plan as planned at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting scheduled for the coming day, Apro Technology's stock price will rise to KRW per share based on a certain amount of money.The great march of bondholders began at this time. Suppose that the stock price after the year the allotted volume is listed is the same circle as the stock price after the reduction.

"KOSDAQ-listed companies with poor financial structure are making early decision to reduce capital.Usually, it is quite different from the fact that the decision to reduce the amount of money was made during the year-end settlement period to improve the financial structure.

In the first half of this year alone, it recorded a cumulative net loss of 100 million won. In addition, in the first half of the year, external auditors rejected opinions due to uncertainty about continuing corporate assumptions and restrictions on the scope of review.A researcher at Smallcap analyzed that financial authorities are recently strengthening their monitoring standards for marginal companies, and that if they decide to reduce the amount due to the close of the settlement period, they cannot avoid the eyes of financial authorities.Reporter Kang Jae-woong, today's hot news is expected to hit 10,000 units in the first week of iPhone sales.If the application was deleted after the update of the Jobs effect Apple, Kim Tae-hee took over Japan's subway occupation.
