2,"Procurement of a total of 100 million won including bequest society | This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. G&ST was designated as an investment alert due to its weak profitability and capital erosion. The reality of G&ST is that it is impossible to operate a normal company without external financing as it has recorded an operating loss every year for consecutive years since 2008. Although sales increased by more than 100 million won, operating loss only decreased by 100 million won. This is because cost of sales and SG&A expenses increased in proportion to sales. Financial expenses also amounted to billions of won, resulting in a net loss of billions of won. It has a structure in which expenses increase as income increases. Even looking at the results of this quarter, a turnaround is not expected to be easy. Sales decreased to 100 million won, less than half of the same period of the previous year, and operating loss was similar to the previous year by 100 million won. As the net loss continued, the loss also increased to 100 million won. As of the end of the year, G&ST's capital erosion rate reached . Companies with a capital erosion rate exceeding , are also designated as managed items according to the exchange regulations that require them to be designated as managed items. A regulation that allows companies to make losses for consecutive years after the year of 2008 may also affect whether they are listed on the delisting substantive examination. entered the market. In its first year of listing, it recorded sales of KRW 100 million and operating profit of KRW 100 million. The operating profit margin reached . Even at this time, color CRTs were in the spotlight because of their superior price competitiveness compared to mine. The operating profit margin of G&ST declined sharply over the years. In the year following the listing, sales increased to KRW 100 million, but the operating profit margin decreased to . due to increased cost of sales and SG&A expenses. In the year when sales decreased to 100 million won, it recorded an operating profit of just over 100 million won. This is because, as the market grew rapidly, it replaced color CRT. G&ST turned to a loss-making company for the last time after recording an operating surplus for the year. G&ST's loss streak, which started in 2011, has continued for the past year. From this point on, G&ST started to live on through external financing. Over the years, G&ST has conducted a total number of rights offerings, including shareholder allocation and general public offering for allotment to third parties, and issued convertible bonds one after the other with warrants. The funds raised through the capital increase alone amounted to KRW 100 million, and the funds raised through W and more than KRW 100 million. G&ST continued to receive external blood transfusions, but was unable to use it as a live ammunition to advance into new businesses. This is because the amount of procurement was at a level that was urgent to make up for the loss with as little as 100 million won when the size of the procurement was large. For a turnaround, G&ST entered the backlight power supply business and home shopping online shopping mall business one after another. However, he was hesitant to make a large-scale investment and continued a vicious cycle of failure because he was in a hurry to follow market trends. This is when the lighting business was just starting to get into the limelight. Lumisys, which was expected to play a key role, posted a net loss of nearly 100 million won a year.

16,"Promotion of large potato reduction...The Bell, which may be directly engaged in medical device manufacturing | This article was published in the capital market media Money Today. G&ST, which has decided to reduce the size of the capital market, is expected to get out of the management category without too much trouble. However, along with capital erosion, the weak profitability that made G&ST a part of the stock market alert is a task that must be resolved. To this end, G&ST is planning to enter the medical device distribution business as a new business. At the beginning, it generates sales of about 100 million won per month, and in the second half of the year, it is aiming for sales of more than 100 million won. This is to avoid being subjected to a substantive review of delisting by lowering the capital erosion rate. The ratio of potatoes to large is a high measure to minimize market shock. The question is how much and how long the potato effect will last. It is a common opinion in the gay industry that diluting the deficit that has snowballed due to the continued operating loss is only a workaround. The reality of G&ST is that, without a dramatic turnaround, it cannot fall into a swamp of deficits again. If the potato is cut on the first day of the month, G&ST's capital will decrease from 100 million won to 100 million won. Assuming there is no change in the remaining capital items, the capital erosion rate, which was close to , will drop sharply. It will be excluded from the substantive review of delisting. As mentioned above, if the de-magnetization is completed, G&ST's balance sheet will have a profit of KRW 100 million in potato gain. However, as of the quarter, the deficit amounted to a much higher amount of KRW billion. In addition, the profit from potatoes is only an account change for accounting, and there is no actual cash inflow, so there is a limit to fundamentally improving the company's constitution. In the end, the self-rescue measures that G&ST can choose are to increase sales and improve profitability, thereby increasing the cash flow from operating activities. It is only a principled thing to increase creativity. This is also directly related to the resolution of the weak profitability item, which is one of the reasons for G&ST's designation as an investment alert. It is a business that sells medical equipment, including diagnostic kits, to hospitals and large medical institutions. Medical device distribution has already been added to the business purpose. The company expects that, if the medical device distribution business is on a normal track, it will record sales at the level of last year and generate some operating profit. He said that the current goal is to generate sales of about 100 million won per month in the beginning and record sales of 100 million won throughout the second half of the year, he said. G&ST is also considering a plan to directly engage in the medical device manufacturing business depending on the market situation. As G&ST has no borrowings and no issues related to management transparency have ever been raised, if it succeeds in resolving capital encroachment and converting to a profit, it is a stock to attract investors. looking forward to getting out. In fact, among the debts of G&ST, short-term and long-term borrowings are zero. Since there is no financial cost, if only operating profit is generated, a significant portion of this is directly related to net profit. Company officials reduced expenses through large-scale layoffs. He said that it is possible to turn to the black, and he said earlier this year, during the capital increase process, the supervisory authority and the host company diagnosed that the internal control system was perfect.

41,"Behind the scenes of improving financial structure...Purchasing land repurchase rights in Daebu-dong, Ansan, Gyeonggi-do The Bell|This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. thanks to the success in Over the past year, it has raised more than 100 million won through capital increase and the issuance of bonds with warrants. Among them, the issuance of billions of won is included. The strange thing is that Tri-Circle invested such a large amount in real estate beneficiary certificates rather than repaying borrowings. The size of the procurement is billions of won. The issuance of a rights issue through the issuance of new shares is a gain. The issuance scale is 100 million won through a rights issue. The general public offering and private offering are the same in each number. The amount of money poured by ordinary investors is about 100 million won. In general, companies designated as investment alerts often try to raise funds to raise operating funds and improve their financial structure. The same goes for tricycles. It is urgent to raise funds for the waste copper recycling project, which is being promoted as a new project. The debt-to-equity ratio should also be lowered. Tri-Circle issued 100 million won per month last year and set a whopping 100 million won in exchange for warrants. The total amount of capital has increased abnormally. On the other hand, other non-current liabilities, which belong to liabilities, are generally accounted for as liabilities because they are obligated to repay only KRW 100 million. If 100 million won is recognized as debt and the remaining 100 million won is recognized as warrant, the debt ratio of the tri-circle rises to . Even the existence of the company is threatened. Moreover, Tri-Circle was unable to repay the 100 million won borrowed from the financial company and the company's assets were seized. The billion won was used to purchase real estate. Tri-Circle signed a contract to acquire the repurchase right of land in Daebu-dong, Danwon-gu, Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do, owned by Korea General Construction last month. Based on this repurchase right, it also took over a certificate of secured beneficiary rights issued by Korea Asset Trust. Ownership of the repurchase rights was transferred to Korea General Construction Apec Engineering Im Hyun-taek Tri-Circle. The total amount of the acquisition is Rs. Tri-Circle raised its funds by issuing 100 million won worth of cash to 100 million won. In other words, the land in Daebudong-dong was issued as collateral. The land in Daebudong-dong is in the process of developing a large-scale resort complex with the goal of one year. The redemption right purchased by Tri-Circle can be exercised from the middle of the month. In other words, it is possible to convert into cash after a year or so. It goes beyond common sense in terms of scale. The 100 million won raised by issuance is close to the amount of the funds raised by Tri-Circle in recent years. The 100 million won invested in land purchase is . If the funds raised by Tri-Circle are used for debt repayment and investment in new businesses, the company's financial structure and profit structure can be greatly improved. He explained that he had purchased a redemption ticket. Unable to repay the tri-circle loan, forcible seizure"
42,"Changed the industry to the stem cell resource development business after a year The Bell|This article was published in the monthly capital market media Money Today. The two reasons why the Tri-Circle was designated as an investment alert are its weak profitability and sluggish sales performance. Tri-Circle has been in the red from year to quarter this year. The scale of sales has also been on a downward trend since last year. The cause of the sluggish performance is that ambitious new businesses are failing one after another. They even changed the name and tried stem cell business and waste recycling business, but the results were not satisfactory. Rather, sales from the existing education business are still approaching . The market outlook is not good either. This is because the industry change was focused on the KOSDAQ theme stocks of bio and resource development. Lowering the debt-to-equity ratio due to excessive overwriting of warrants for new stocks. In the case of sales, after recording KRW billion a year, the downward trend continues to KRW billion billion. It has not been able to get out of the swamp of operating losses since 2011. In the same year, it recorded an operating loss of KRW billion more than sales. Cash flow from operating activities has also been in the red since 2011. It was the investors, not the management, who suffered damage from the poor performance of the Tri-Circle. Year month versus potato was carried out. The capital was reduced from one billion won to one billion won. At that time, the tri-circle's capital erosion rate was close to . To avoid delisting, the card was taken out. Despite poor performance, Tri-Circle's debt-to-equity ratio is ., which is not something to be concerned about. The problem is that there is a trick hidden here. Last month, the company issued bonds with warrants worth KRW 100 million to Hyun-taek Lim. Usually, since the issuer is obligated to repay, most of the amount is taken as debt and a portion of this amount is taken as consideration for warrants and recognized as equity. The total amount of capital has increased accordingly. Conversely, the remaining KRW 100 million was recorded as other non-current liabilities. Naturally, the debt-to-equity ratio fell abnormally. An official in the securities industry said that he had tried countless issuance weeks, but that he had never seen such a calculation method, and pointed out that the amount of warrants was overstated. It can be seen that this is serious. The company's current ratio is only . It is not enough for the ideal ratio. This is a result far from the good debt-to-equity ratio figure. Education business's sales share still closes Tri-Circle was once a promising education company. Backed by the craze for private education, it was listed on the KOSDAQ market in January. In the process, it also brought savory returns to venture capitalists. It consistently recorded operating profit and showed good performance. The change occurred when the largest shareholder was changed to Creo Investment in May. Suddenly, stem cells were added as a new business, and the company name was changed from Confirmed English to Life & B. And a year later, the industry changed again to the resource recycling business. The company name was changed to Tri-Circle. It happened in just a few years. The success or failure of a new business is markedly different. In the case of stem cell business, even sales are not being caught. Looking at the proportion of sales as of the quarter of this year, the education business was . The resource business accounts for . The education business, which used to be the company's main business, still plays a pivotal role. Although the proportion of sales from the resource business is close to , even this is not highly trusted by the market. Tri-Circle signed a supply contract worth KRW 100 million with Bada E&R last month, but the contract was terminated last month. It's all about getting a billion-dollar down payment. As a result, the exchange was designated as a negligent disclosure corporation and a penalty was imposed. Doubts still remain in that all new businesses are KOSDAQ's regular theme stocks. An official from the securities industry said that the reality of the largest shareholder is still unclear and the performance of the new business is not good.

Tri-Circle announced that it would alleviate the current financial tightness by raising around 100 million won in funding within the year. Through this, the plan is to break out of the stock market for investors next year.

He added that the possibility of early redemption is open because all of the land other than the land owned by Tri-Circle has been repurchased. Regarding the fact that the repurchase rights were transferred to Korea General Construction Apec Engineering Lim Hyun-taek Tri-Circle, he explained that it was due to the complicated internal circumstances of Korea General Construction and that it was all sorted out now. state Tri-Circle borrowed KRW 100 million from Kookmin Bank and Industrial Bank of Korea Technology Credit Guarantee Fund last year, but could not repay it, so the company's land and building available-for-sale securities were seized.

57,"Introduction of the subject of revocation of securities declarations Market Insights Monday noon R&L Bio, a listed company on the time-shared stock market, and R&L Sammi, a KOSDAQ-listed company, announced a merger on Monday of last year. However, the merger did not take place, only making corrections to postpone the schedule of the general meeting of shareholders and the board of directors for the merger over the course of a year and a half. This is because the Financial Supervisory Service requested correction of the securities declaration form, but it has not been able to submit a correction report. Tri-Circle, a KOSDAQ-listed company, was also asked to submit a correction report after it decided to issue monthly bonds with warrants on a monthly basis last year, but it has been silent for years. In the meantime, only small public offerings in the unit of 100 million won are being conducted intermittently, which are exempt from filing a securities declaration. Dworks Global, too, has failed to submit a securities declaration, only announcing corrections after deciding on a capital increase of 100 million won last month. Only investors are confused by the announcement of mergers and issuances of listed companies without a promise. R&L Sammi, whose stock price has plummeted since the merger announcement, is sensitive to corrections, such as recording the upper limit whenever the merger schedule is delayed. put the brakes on the According to the Japanese financial authorities, if a listed company that issues securities such as mergers and capital increase convertible bonds or corporate bonds in the future does not submit a securities declaration within a certain period of time after being requested by the financial authorities to submit a correction report, the issuance decision will be automatically withdrawn. The financial authorities reflected the system for deeming the withdrawal of securities declarations as described above in the revised capital market law submitted to the National Assembly on Monday. The current Capital Markets Act only provides for a regulation that financial authorities may request the submission of a correction report. For this reason, it was enough if a listed company did not respond even after being asked for correction. The Financial Services Commission plans to revise the enforcement ordinance as soon as the amendment to the Capital Market Act passes the National Assembly and fix the deadline for submitting the correction report. It is known that the submission deadline is within a month or less. Reporter Jung Young-hyo .

Insun ENT added as a new business One is automobile parts manufacturing, automobile and parts sales, domestic and foreign resource exploration business, domestic and foreign resource extraction business, domestic and foreign resource development business, mineral resource trade, mineral resource production, mineral resource processing, mineral resource sales business.

It is a legal problem for the company to develop overseas resources it is not that there is If it is approved through a due process, there is no problem in doing business. However, it is necessary to take into account that there are not many successful cases in the market through resource development disclosure in general. According to the Korea Exchange, from last year to In the KOSDAQ market until now, delisting companies related to resource development include Dahui Doolim TNC Mora Resources IRD GNT Holdings Kenertech Eco Solution Woosoo CNS KENG Fournet Holdings Neo Source E&Tech Handysoft Max Bro Gloworks. Among them, one of the companies has been delisted, designated as a management stock, or designated as a marginal company, such as an investment alert. Cases of unfair trade using resource development disclosures such as changes have been caught. Not all resource development fails or is mobilized to manipulate stock prices, but there are not many successful cases. Although the current Lee Myung-bak government promoted resource diplomacy, last year Cases of failure were also on the cutting edge of state audits and were intensively beaten. It is not easy for the government to proceed. Also, this is the same for large corporations. According to chaebol.com, all affiliates established by large groups for overseas resource development were as of the month of last year, and among them, only .in companies made a profit for the year. Only one of the large group affiliated resource development corporations It is said that the others made a profit and either made a loss or failed to increase sales. It is not easy for the government or large corporations, but it is not easy for KOSDAQ companies, which are generally small in scale, to succeed in resource development. This is because the time required for exploration and development is long and the probability of failure is high. Byung-cheol Yoo, Reporter of World Finance .

Most of the companies that have been designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations have already gone out of the market due to several reasons of infidelity. Among them, Humantech Korea was designated as a non-faithful disclosure corporation twice this month by belatedly informed of the overdue loan principal and interest and the occurrence of embezzlement and breach of trust. Currently, the cumulative penalty point is . However, just before the last trading suspension, the stock price of Ilwa Humantech Korea went straight to the upper limit, and even in the .

Kookil Paper posted a net profit of about KRW 100 million last year, but this year, it recorded a net loss of KRW billion until the quarter, and its performance deteriorated. Kookil Paper Co., Ltd., an affiliate, is also having a sluggish year, recording a net loss of about 100 million won until last quarter.

In the stock market, stock trading is also suspended, and it has been designated as a management item and as a corporation that discloses unfaithfulness.

131,"A corner-driven KOSDAQ company suddenly turns in the black Senit Wookyung G&ST, etc., may change its earnings without audits.. A company that recorded operating losses for a risky year when investing only by looking at disclosures earned 100 million won in operating profit in three months. This is the story of Wookyung, a KOSDAQ-listed company that has recorded an operating loss for years from last year and is on the verge of exiting the stock market due to an operating loss for a year in a row. You should pay attention to what will change after the audit by an external auditor. According to the Financial Supervisory Service of Japan and the Korea Exchange, KOSDAQ-listed companies that have recorded operating losses for one consecutive year from this year will be delisted. This is because it is the first year in which operating losses are applied for consecutive years newly added by the Korea Exchange due to trade and trade regulations. The first case has already appeared. Orient Present became the first stock to be withdrawn from the stock market due to operating losses for the past year in a row. As a result of this, as of the end of last month, minority shareholders holding . Senit C&K Inter, Ntopia Wookyung, Innocell G&ST PSMC, etc. are the main culprits. These companies announced that their operating profit turned to black last year by disclosing abnormal changes in sales or profit and loss structure starting this month. Among them, Ntopia Innocell PSM and other companies successfully turned to black after receiving an appropriate opinion from an external auditor. However, the rest of Senit C&K Inter, Wookyung G&ST, etc., can be sufficiently overturned by the unaudited company's self-aggregated performance. In particular, Wookyung and C&K Inter recorded operating losses until last month, and then the operating profit they earned for three months after that month.

132,"The right-wing policy of the Shinzo Abe administration in Japan has begun in earnest. It is quite different from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who sent a gesture of reconciliation to neighboring countries just before taking office. From the beginning of the new year, they are making strides toward fulfilling the pledge to move toward the right. First of all, from the middle of this month, it was decided to set up an expert meeting to materialize the right-wing policy. The National Security Council for the right to collective self-defence, a promise made by the Abe administration in the general election, will be established in relation to the historical awareness education reform. This will be led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who is Abe's right-hand man. In fact, it is the first step towards realizing a right-wing foreign and security policy. Taking the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands as a pretext, it was decided to increase the defense cost for the first time in a year. Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera appeared on a Japanese TV show and said that while Japan's defense cost has been cut for a year in a row, while neighboring countries have gradually increased their defense costs, a definitive defense system He suggested an increase in defense spending by requesting a budget to make it possible. While Prime Minister Abe revised the Articles of the Peace Constitution to allow for the exercise of the right to collective self-defense, even increasing defense spending is his will to strengthen the military power. Relations with China have been frozen since the beginning of the year. Prime Minister Abe also ordered the strengthening of the defense system on the Senkaku Islands. He called the Ministry of Defense officials to his official residence and ordered them to improve the Air Self-Defense Force's fighter operations to prevent the intrusion of Chinese aircraft over the Senkaku Islands. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is also considering the early introduction of the Global Hawk, a state-of-the-art U.S. reconnaissance aircraft, to strengthen surveillance on Senkaku. As a result, the war of nerves between the two sides over the sovereignty of Senkaku has reached its climax, and there is even a sense of imminent danger. Even the US ally, the US, is burdened by the Abe administration's actions. The US government put the brakes on the Abe administration's move to revise historical perceptions such as the Kono Statement, demanding a cautious response. Foreign media also expressed concern. The New York Times warned in an editorial on the last day that Abe's shameful impulse could threaten regional cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue and other issues. As the Abe administration's historical consciousness is regressing, the situation in Northeast Asia is getting tougher. Correspondent Kwon Do-kyung.

136,"Eddy Holdings and Eddy Company will jointly advance into the laser touch screen business. According to IL Eddy Holdings and Eddy Company, the laser-type touch sensor technology has been developed by Smart Sense Technology with the support of Eddy Holdings. After a product demonstration for touch sensor electronic board for over a year from last month, the product is about to be commercialized. In particular, Smart Sense Technology, together with EDID, has been in consultation with Samsung Electronics to market the touch sensor electronic board since the beginning of this year. The company said it was listening. Among them, the extra-large touch screen has excellent touch and writing sensitivity, so it will be supplied as an electronic blackboard to the domestic and overseas education markets. He explained that he is currently discussing application plans for various products with Samsung Electronics as well as domestic display companies such as Daewoo Display and overseas companies such as Apple OSRAM. This product is suitable for optical touch sensors using existing cameras or UV arrays. Compared to that, it has excellent precision and writing feel, so it is possible to write with the thickness of a general marker pen. In addition, the company explains that it has succeeded in single moduleization, which is pointed out as the biggest drawback of the existing optical touch method, and has dramatically reduced the manufacturing cost increase rate according to the screen size. In particular, the laser type touch sensor used in the product uses a laser plane. It is composed of a module to make and a retroreflective strip that efficiently reflects the laser. Also, it is noteworthy that it will have a big impact on the generalization of touch screens in the future because it is advantageous for producing overlay products that can be used as touch screens by overlaying them on existing monitors.

A patent application is pending. An official from Eddie Holdings said that it is expected to open the way for the popularization of large-screen touch screens in the future with significantly improved overall performance compared to existing products and market competitiveness due to reduced manufacturing cost in half. He explained that the sensor technology can be applied not only to the electronic board, but also to general monitors and smart devices. The world market for touch panels to which laser touch screens can be applied is about billions of dollars a year, and the domestic production scale including exports is about trillions of dollars. It is estimated that EdD Holdings and EDID Company plan to lead the domestic and overseas touch screen market with various products in the future, and they are aiming to occupy more than domestic market share in the future.

140,"The weight of personal debt repayment probability | This article was published in the capital market media Money Today on Monday. The largest shareholder of Eddy Holdings, which acquired Eddy Company, sold a large amount of Eddy Company stock in order to repay the acquisition funds. Allegations were raised that it was intended for CEO Kim seems to have personally borrowed money to repay the financing for the Jati Electronics acquisition from investment securities. CEO Hee-Nam Kim sold all of EdD Company's stocks on the market last month for a total of 100 million won. The Edie D Company explained that CEO Kim sold his stake to finance the acquisition of the building. However, the securities industry weighed heavily on the belief that CEO Kim would have used the funds secured by selling his stock to pay off personal debts. leave it It is highly probable that this was a loan caused by an individual in the process of EDD Holdings' acquisition of Jati Electronics. CEO Kim Hee-nam and others took over shares and management rights from JAT Electronics CEO Lee Kwang-soon last month for a total of 100 million won. After paying a down payment of 100 million won as internal funds, EDID Holdings issued bonds with warrants to investment securities to raise the balance of 100 million won. An official familiar with the transaction said that he knew that he was fully reimbursed immediately after the deal worth 100 million won, and that he had sold all of the warrants to Eddie Holdings. Most of the repayment funds flowed from Econex, the largest shareholder of EDID Holdings. Looking at the specific details, it was found that the 100 million won that Econex borrowed from Eddy Holdings last year and the 100 million won that Eddy Holdings paid in advance to Econex were returned to Eddy Holdings. Econex lent an additional 100 million won to this. Econex invested a total of 100 million won in Eddie Holdings. This means that the remaining billions of won had to be raised. However, it seems that it is not easy for Eddie Holdings to obtain this money in a few days, which was not easy enough to cover most of the acquisition funds through external procurement. It is for this reason that there is an observation that CEO Kim personally made a loan. An official from the securities industry said that it is highly probable that CEO Kim personally borrowed money for the purpose of raising some of the necessary funds for repayment. It may have been used to settle this debt. An ED Holdings official said that he knew that CEO Kim sold his stake to raise funds for the relocation of a factory in Anyang, Gyeonggi-do and operation of the company.

171,"The number of employees has emerged as a major investment indicator for investors in the KOSDAQ market. This is because companies with a small number of employees have been delisted one after another or are in the process of being expelled. Infinite Investment, which started a day-to-day trading, has the peculiarity of being a start-up investment company, but has only a few employees. In the first half of the year, the operating profit was only 100 million won, while the net loss reached 100 million won. It is the first time in half a year that it has made a loss of KRW 100 million per person. In addition, Stem Science, which has a management issue, has a number of employees, including contract employees. NK Bio, a bio company that had been withdrawn earlier, was also named. UI Energy, which made a decision to withdraw from the substantive review committee of the Korea Exchange late on the night of the night, is similar. UI Energy has a splendid business, such as oil field development, Gulf of Mexico gas field development, and iron ore development and importation in Iraq within the Kurdistan Autonomous Government, but has only one employee. C&K Inter, which jumped to the top in market capitalization by promoting that it obtained the rights to develop Cameroon diamonds, also has a number of employees. Others who said they did not qualify as regular contract workers were also included in the list. It is estimated that he is a freelancer or a part-timer. Nevertheless, C&K Inter has a market capitalization of 100 million won. Freshway POSCO M-Tech, which has a lower market capitalization than C&K, has about one person each. There are many companies that do not have a label for management items, but have a small number of employees. Luxon Energy Holdings has only one employee, and Terra Resource has only one. This is the level of employment of real estate brokerages commonly seen in the neighborhood. As it is a company operated with a minimum number of manpower, most of them are not avoiding losses. There are even companies with a structure that has more net losses than sales. There is even room for interpretation that corporate activities have already been suspended. An expert in the securities industry said that the number of employees clearly influences the substantive review process for delisting. He pointed out that if there is no main business, it is absolutely at a disadvantage in the substantive examination. The related company explains that it is because of the specificity of the business. A person in charge of a company does not have a factory and does not need to have many employees. He said that he could only avoid the delisting requirements. Another official explained that we mainly do resource development, but we are only approaching it as an investment business anyway, so all we need is a person in charge of disclosure and accounting.

201,"It is not the final auditing agency related to the exchange. There is no legal basis for disapproval because it meets the requirements of the Financial Supervisory Service. It is pointed out that the disclosure system prepared to protect investors and improve corporate transparency is only illusory. As a result, the authorities and the Korea Exchange are backing down that there was no problem in the disclosure procedure. Stock market experts point out that such a passive response to corporate disclosure can lead to corporate moral hazard. According to the Japanese financial investment industry, listed companies are required to submit reports on major issues stipulated in the Capital Market Act to the Financial Supervisory Service, and exchanges When there is a major change in the sales and production activities of companies listed on the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets, relevant information is provided to investors through disclosure. It is only repeating the position that it is not an auditing institution. According to the KOSDAQ market disclosure regulations, the KOSDAQ market disclosure regulations are responsible for the stock exchange disclosure by car and the designated accounting firm in charge of the audit of the company car. RexL&G's union official said at a meeting held twice a day last month that there was no actual production activity due to the shutdown of the factory. Rex L&G announced a surplus of KRW 100 million in the quarter and subsequently signed a supply contract for LEDs worth KRW 100 million. Even when the person in charge talked with the chairman several times to resolve the conflict between labor and management, no matter what the process, only sales need to be captured. He said that he had heard that the exchange only looked at the figures anyway. In response, an official from the KOSDAQ corporate review team of the exchange said that the exchange is also supervising and managing based on company information obtained through substantive examination, etc. Another official said that the exchange is managing a listed company, but the person in charge of preparing the car is the company and the person in charge of the car is an external auditor. He said that even if he did, it wouldn't work. However, he added that if a problem is discovered through false disclosure, the task is transferred to the Financial Supervisory Service, which has the authority to investigate the accounting supervision. The reason is that even an insolvent company has no legal basis to disapprove a request for capital increase/decrease if it goes through procedures such as disclosure. did. Under the circumstances, public opinion against the approval was strong as the major shareholder was recognized as an intention to steal funds, but there is no legal basis to immediately reject it. Therefore, the FSS review is expected to resume depending on whether a court decision is made. Golden Bridge is an insolvent company with a near-capital erosion rate and a debt-to-equity ratio of . IDEN was judged to be insolvent, such as delaying the maturity date of bonds with warrants four times due to financial difficulties, but succeeded in capital increase without any sanctions. An official from the Financial Supervisory Service said that there is no mechanism to prevent the issue of capital increase just because the company is insolvent because capital increase is a matter of the company's board of directors. He explained that he made it possible for investors to receive information. He pointed out that even if it is a rotten apple, if they tell us that the apple is rotten, it is the investor's responsibility to take a step back. Even if there is, efforts should be made to minimize the damage to investors who are in the blind spot of the law. He pointed out that ex-post responsibility should be ensured for any damage to investors caused by false disclosure. . Correspondent Park So-yeon, copyright holder Financial News.

204,"An increasing number of listed companies are unable to repay the principal and interest of loans and bonds. This is because it is difficult to raise funds due to worsening investor sentiment and prolonged economic downturn. Most of the stock prices of companies that have made public announcements in this regard are being pointed out that investors need to be careful as they have fallen sharply. According to the electronic disclosure of the Financial Supervisory Service in Japan, there are a number of listed companies that have announced that they have not paid principal and interest on bonds this year. This is more than double the number during the same period last year. Morins Hanjin PNC Wise Power Ohsung LST UBI Precision SDN listed on the KOSDAQ and Woongjin Energy China Ocean Resources listed on the KOSPI announced that they could not pay the principal and interest of bonds. Yuil Nsys was also a company that made a public announcement at the time, but now the company has been delisted. There are also some listed companies that announced that they were overdue for the principal and interest of the loan this year. This is similar to the same period last year. Kumho Industrial Heavy Industries Engine listed on the KOSPI and Osung LST Rex L&G Sublimation Freetech listed on the KOSDAQ market announced that they could not pay the principal and interest of the loan. Jenner Systems, Withas Neo Purple, etc. were also listed companies that made public announcements at the time, but these companies are now delisted. In the case of Rex L&G, it was the only listed company that announced that it was not able to repay the principal and interest of the loan this year as well as last year. Morrins recorded a lower price the next day on the news that the bond principal and interest could not be paid on the day of last month. It was also announced on the day, but the stock price fell about the day. After the announcement on the first day of last month, the stock price of CNU dropped . Securities experts point out that the fact that a listed company cannot pay the principal and interest of loans or debentures is a bad situation for internal funds. A securities expert advised that investment should be cautious as there have been cases where a company that made a related disclosure was delisted due to capital encroachment. . Inspirit Luxon Energy Holdings, Enter Technology, Kumkang Steel, Uable Accutech, etc."
205,"Although listed companies often change their company name to improve their corporate image, it does not seem to help much for the stock price. Shares of companies that have announced a change of name this year have plummeted. Investors may feel insecure about the unfamiliar name of the company, and experts point out that performance should be supported by the stock price rise above all else. According to the Korea Exchange, there are a total of companies that have changed their company name this year. Although there were divisions and mergers and acquisitions, most of the companies promoted corporate image enhancement. Almost all companies changed their names to improve their image. However, instead of improving their images, most of the stock prices of the companies that changed their names fell. Of these, as a result of examining all companies except for those that have been suspended or delisted, the stock price of the company has fallen compared to before the change of name. The average decline of each company was , and Gemvax and Sublimation Freetech experienced a decline in each. Rex L&G, which changed the company name in May, has changed its name five times since its establishment as Fairchild Semicore in March, Fairchild Semicon Doctor National Semicon Doctor Fairchild Kiryung Electronics Kiryung E&E. Wonik Cube, which changed its name in the same month, also started as Samjong Ind. Co., Ltd. and then changed the sign four times to Logit Corporation, Hunus, etc. Sublime Freetech, a company specializing in construction safety management, announced the change of name again last month, just a month after changing from sublime luxury construction to S2. Neurotech and R&L Sammi, which are managed items, were suspended from trading with Araontech and Nature Cell, respectively, and Dworks Global and Orient Present respectively changed to Uable Present. It is even pointed out that the name change is degenerating into a means of washing the image of companies with poor performance. Rather than recovering performance and renewing the corporate image, they are trying to deceive investors through the easy method of changing the name. Rex L&G, which has changed its actual name frequently, has less than KRW 100 million in quarterly sales and trades until the subject of delisting is confirmed. The transaction is suspended. Wonik Cube also received police investigation into a former executive who recently resigned on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust, while Sublime Freetech was designated as a disloyalty disclosure corporation by belatedly disclosing the fact that the principal and interest of the loan were overdue. Investors are advised to be cautious, such as carefully examining the financial statements. Kim Eun-ki, an analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities, said that the name change acted as a material for stock price rise in the past, but recently this trend has been diminishing. Im Chae-woon, a professor of business administration at Sogang University, faces significant investment risks even if the company name is changed due to business structure changes such as entry into new businesses.

247,"The Bell | This article was published in the capital market media Money Today on Monday. Interest is growing whether the touch screen panel maker Morins will succeed in turning to profit this year. Achieving stable sales and profits. However, the performance deteriorated as the mobile phone market rapidly changed to the capacitive method. In order to respond to the market change, Morins has made a large-scale facility investment from 2011 and is planning to mass-produce touch panel products with integrated cover glass from this quarter. This is also the reason why Now Capital recently invested KRW 100 million in Morin's issue. Failed to respond to loss-transfer capacitive touch panel The performance of Morinth, a company listed on the Tokkosdaq, has been on a downward trajectory since 2011. Sales hit an all-time high of billions of won per year, and then halved to 100 million won at the end of the year. During the same period, the operating profit changed from 100 million won to an operating loss of 100 million won. Although sales increased slightly last year, it did not succeed in turning around by recording sales of 100 million won and operating loss of 100 million won until the quarter. The failure to respond quickly to changes was largely affected. Major customers, Samsung Electronics and Samsung Mobile Display Electronics, sharply reduced the proportion of resistive touch panels from . However, as Morins was unable to produce capacitive touch panels, the facility utilization rate fell sharply. The fixed cost burden increased further as the facility was changed to capacitive type in a hurry. Morins planned to mass-produce the glass-integrated touch panel in 2018, but could not achieve proper performance because it did not get approval from the customer. An analyst at a securities firm said that, despite the technological superiority of the resistive touch panel, Morins spent too much time and money on the production of the capacitive touch panel. Requires verification such as turnaround expected defect rate for mass production of touch panel It has already replaced the touch panel equipment with a method that has already invested 100 million won, and has also obtained approval for delivery from customers such as Samsung Electronics. This is the reason why we can expect an earnings turnaround as sales increase again this year. Morins has recently secured KRW 100 million in bonds with warrants to supplement issuance facilities and to secure operating funds. A Maurins official said that if the mass-produced touch panel is mass-produced, the performance will be greatly improved, and a turnaround is expected as early as this quarter. This is because competitors that mass-produce capacitive products are already occupying the market, and they have to verify the defect rate, etc. In fact, the products that Maurins will mass-produce are not expected to be applied to Samsung Electronics' new products, but to low-end smartphones. It means that there is a difference in technology with competitors. An official from a touch screen company said that although Maurins-style touch panel facilities were prepared, it takes about a quarter more time to lead to an increase in sales or profits.

310,"There is an increasing number of cases in which listed companies change their names after the regular general meeting of shareholders. The total number of listed companies that have changed or will change their name this year is total. All of the drugs were listed on the KOSDAQ market, and each company was listed on the stock market. There were usually three reasons for the name change: loyalty, image emphasizing parent company, and diversionary. Loyalty of the parent company to benefit the parent company First, the name is changed due to a change in equity structure or business restructuring. Halla Climate Control, listed on the stock market, changed its name to Halla Visteon Climate Control. The parent company's mission was added during the merger and acquisition of the HVAC business of Visteon, the largest shareholder. In addition, Innocell, which was listed on the KOSDAQ market, was acquired by Green Cross Group, a pharmaceutical company, and changed to Green Cross Cell. Syntech was acquired by Hansol Group and changed its sign to Hansol Syntech. Another affiliate, Art One Paper, changed its name to Hansol Art One Paper.

Leehom, famous for rice cooker Leehom and Cuchen, changed its name to Leehomkuchen, a combination of its two own brands. Nowcom also brought its mission to Africa, its main business internet service. Lotte Samkang decided to change its name to Lotte Food to consolidate each food affiliate of the Lotte Group and emphasize the image of a food company. Pocket Games, which acquired the low-cost carrier T'way Air, changes its name to T'way Holdings. Considering that its headquarters is located in Jeju Island, it plans to change its name to Jeju Semiconductor. KNDT&I decided to change to Orbitek in line with its entry into the aviation business, and Sungchang Airtech changed its name to Seongchang Autotech by merging its subsidiary Cosmocell. KONA I and Sambo Industries Genexine decided to change their English name. In some cases, the company seems to have changed its name in order to renew the company's image in the event of a transformational loss after breaking away from the existing company image. In a good way, it may be a change of mood or image renewal, or in a bad way, it may be a so-called trick to avoid stinging eyes. Shellline, a mobile communication device company, changed its name to E-Film. The company has been in operating loss every year since last year. Sky New Pharm, which was acquired by CHA Bio&Diostek, an affiliate of the CHA Hospital Group, also decided to change its name to a pharmaceutical company. This company also recorded an operating loss last year. MB Seongsan and Nitgen & Company, which recorded losses last year, also decided to change the company to Metal Integrated Energy, respectively. Daechang Metal Digital Ocean Korea also changed its name. Companies that have been designated as management items or whose transactions have been suspended have also been renamed. Neurotech and R&L Sammi, which are management items, decided to change to Araontech and Nature Cell, respectively. Dworks Global, which has been suspended from trading, has also changed to U.A., and Orient Present is scheduled to change to Present. Share price effect of name change Well, securities experts point out that there is no need to expect a significant increase in share price from a company name change. Although there are some exceptions, it is analyzed that this is because the change in the company name had little effect on earnings and was insignificant as a factor in the share price rise. Securities experts advise investors to look at the financial statements of companies that change their names. A researcher at a brokerage company said that the name change sometimes affects performance improvement by improving the corporate image or strengthening the brand. In some cases, he said that the company name change announcement should be carefully looked at.
