3,"Listed companies that posted operating losses for consecutive years, such as INCS Comtech, decide whether to delist after a substantive examination when the listed companies continue to lose money for consecutive years. In the case of a listed company on the KOSDAQ market, if it records an annual loss for one consecutive year, it is designated as a management item and if it records a loss for one consecutive year, it may be removed from the stock market through a listing qualification substantive examination. The number of KOSDAQ-listed companies designated as management stocks by recording operating losses for consecutive business years up to 2016. Among these companies, the delisting procedure was initiated by the incumbent delisting. The remaining companies are expected to decide whether to retire soon. Currently, companies with operating losses for consecutive business years include Codez Combine Pacific Bio Regen Core Logic Sports Seoul Comz Topfield AD Chips Dongil Steel I&C Technology S S Comtech Joymax Corid. It recorded an operating loss of 10,000 won and started the stock exchange transfer procedure last month to be incorporated into a wholly owned subsidiary of Telecom, the largest shareholder. It is scheduled to be delisted on the next day. Corrid, a metal mineral wholesaler, was caught in accounting fraud last month, and the exchange is currently debating whether to delist it. INC and SSC Tech recorded cumulative operating losses of KRW 100 million until the quarter of last year, and if it is confirmed that they did not make up for the loss in the quarter, they will be designated as the subject of substantive examination for delisting decisions. Although it made a profit on a scale, it is in danger of being delisted if there is a deficit on the scale that erodes it in a quarter. Exchange officials previously followed the procedure for delisting immediately when a loss occurred in the first business year, but the listing regulations were revised at the end of last year. He said that from this year, the decision will be made after a substantive examination, and since it is the first settlement period after the change in the rules, it is necessary to wait and see whether or not it will be listed or not.

4,"If I&C and other companies do not turn to profit in the last quarter of last year, there is a growing awareness of companies at risk of exit, which are called 'earning season bombs'. Some KOSDAQ-listed companies are expected to experience operating losses for a year in a row, but their stock prices are on the rise, so caution is required for investment. According to FnGuide, a Japanese financial information company, companies designated as management stocks with losses for consecutive years, a requirement for delisting in the KOSDAQ market, are S&S. Cometek I&C, etc. are all dog sports. These stocks are eligible for delisting if losses continue this year. Comz is already undergoing a voluntary delisting process for incorporation into a wholly owned subsidiary of Telecom, and Corid has recently been delisted due to the detection of fraudulent accounting. If the performance does not turn to a large-scale surplus, there is a high possibility that it will be driven into commodities. SComtech recorded a cumulative operating loss of KRW 100 million until the quarter of last year. I&C also managed to record an operating surplus of 100 million won in the quarter last year, but it is unclear whether the accumulated loss will reach 100 million won and prevent the delisting crisis. The fate of other companies is determined by the quarterly results. Codez Combine, which suffered a controversy due to its inclusion in the small cap index at the beginning of last year, has accumulated operating profit of KRW 100 million until the quarter of last year, but the surplus is not large. Sports Seoul, a monthly settlement company, also achieved cumulative operating profit of more than KRW 100 million as of the first half of last year, but future performance will determine its fate. Companies at risk of delisting are mainly focused on single-shot trading aimed at a time when the stock price plummets after the listing qualification review. You have to be careful, though, because most of them are at a loss. An official from the securities industry said that as the earnings season has begun, you should make a decision to buy or sell based on the quarterly results, and said that you should be extra careful as investors take a lot of damage during the earnings season every year. The surest way to get acquainted with the economy"
5,"As the quarterly earnings season is in full swing, interest is also being drawn to listed companies, which are concerned about exiting the stock market due to sluggish earnings. Since it can be delisted if it records an operating loss for one consecutive year, listed companies that did not escape the operating loss for the quarter must make up for the operating loss in the quarter to avoid delisting. Among the listed stocks, the KOSDAQ listed company that recorded operating losses until the quarter of last year is INC SComtech. According to KOSDAQ regulations, if a listed company makes an operating loss for one consecutive year, it is designated as a management stock. INC, a company specializing in telecommunication semiconductors, recorded an accumulated operating loss of KRW 100 million until the quarter of last year. Although it succeeded in turning to a profit on a quarterly basis for the first time in over a year in the quarter of last year, the surplus was only KRW 100 million. Cumulative operating loss up to the quarter An operating profit of KRW 100 million or more must be paid in a quarter to prevent delisting. The company is expecting the deficit to be resolved and management items removed, saying that the performance of KEPCO's advanced metrology infrastructure business is reflected in some quarterly results. S Comtech was designated as a management item by recording a loss for consecutive years from last year to 2016, and it is recording an accumulated operating loss of KRW 100 million until the quarter. In addition, the reason for the management stock was added as the review opinion of the semi-annual report was rejected. Since the second half of last year, the company has suffered from two suspensions of trading due to the filing of bankruptcy by creditors. However, Corid was recently delisted after fraudulent accounting was discovered last year. Comz is in the process of voluntary delisting for Telecom's incorporation into a wholly owned subsidiary. Core Logic Codez Combine has been designated as a management item with losses for consecutive years, but it is a listed company that is recording a cumulative surplus until the quarter. However, there is a possibility of delisting depending on the quarterly performance as Core Logic's accumulated surplus for the quarter was only 100 million won, and Codez Combine's was only 100 million won. In particular, Codez Combine was known as out of stock last year, and its stock price once rose to 10,000 won, and its stock price is currently hovering around the won. It is said that it is necessary to be very careful about investment because it is a company with abnormal losses, and if an operating loss occurs for more than a year, the company's management is a chronic loss structure, he said."

16,서울뉴시스 에스에스컴텍 자회사 케이스타폰와 협력사 한류스타폰기술개발 법인 등기 모습. 케이스타폰과 한류스타폰 모두 자본금 만원에 설립됐다. 두 회사는 다른 시점에 설립됐지만 사업목적 역시 동일하다.서울뉴시스 한상연 기자 최예린 기자 류은혁 인턴기자  에스에스컴텍이 자회사 및 중국 레노버그룹과 공동 추진했다가 접었던  김수현폰 사업을 페이퍼컴퍼니를 내세워 재추진하고 있다는 의혹이 제기됐다.에스에스컴텍은 해당 회사를 협력사라고 주장하고 있다. 하지만 한류스타폰개발기술이라는 이 협력사가 자본금 만원으로 설립된 점 또 회사 대표가 에스에스컴텍 자회사 대표와 동일인이라는 점이 밝혀지면서 이 같은 의심을 받고 있다.자회사 대표를 이름 뿐인 협력사 대표에 앉혀 놓고 거래내역 공개 등 회계 상의 문제를 피해 가려는 것 아니냐는 지적이 제기될 수 있는 대목이기도 하다.에스에스컴텍은 지난 일 보도자료를 통해 한류스타폰이 레노버 스마트폰 자회사인 북경신기공장과기유한공사와 배우 김수현 초상권 퍼블리시티 계약을 마무리 짓고  김수현폰 사업을 새롭게 시작한다고 밝혔다.에스에스컴텍은 지난해 말  자회사 케이스타폰과 똑같은 내용의 사업을 추진한 바 있다. 당시 김수현 초상권 관련 계약금 미지급 문제 크리스마스를 겨냥해 계획된 중국 현지 이벤트의 안전상 우려 등으로 김수현폰 출시가 무산됐는데 이번에 한류스타폰과 이 사업의 재추진에 들어간 것이다.그러나 한류스타폰은 현재 회사 실체가 파악되지 않고 있다. 또 앞서 사업을 진행했던 케이스타폰과의 인적 교류 흔적까지 발견되며 페이퍼컴퍼니가 아니냐는 의혹을 받고 있다.페이퍼컴퍼니란 물리적 실체가 없는 서류상의 회사로 대개 조세 회피 등의 목적으로 설립되는 경우가 적지 않아 세무당국의 집중 감시 대상이 된다.한류스타폰은 법인등기상 지난 월일 서울 관악구 봉천동 한 상가에 자본금 만원에 설립된 것으로 나타나 있다.그러나 회사가 위치해 있는 것으로 기재된 해당 상가 부동산 관계자는 그런 회사가 들어왔었다는 얘기를 들어본 적이 없다며 실체를 부인했다.인적 구성에도 페이퍼 컴퍼니로 의심가는 지점이 발견된다.에스에스컴텍은 지난해 월 이상숙씨가 대표로 있던 케이스타폰을 만원에 인수했고 그달 말 에스에스컴텍 전재석 대표와 연광모씨가 케이스타폰 공동대표로 취임했다.케이스타폰에 있던 이 전 대표는 법인등기상 월 설립된 한류스타폰의 사내이사로 등재돼 있고 현재는 케이스타폰 연 대표가 한류스타폰의 대표를 겸직하고 있는 것으로 밝혀졌다.에스에스컴텍 관계자도 케이스타폰과 한류스타폰의 대표이사가 동일 인물인 것으로 알고 있다고 이를 인정했다.아울러 법인등기상 케이스타폰과 한류스타폰의 사업목적이 완벽히 동일하다는 점도 함께 드러났다.서울뉴시스에스에스컴텍의 지난해 월 케이스타폰 인수 결정 공시. 공시상에는 현재 한류스타폰개발기술 사내이사로 등재돼 있는 이상숙씨까 대표이사로 나타나 있다.한 법률 전문가는 우리나라의 경우 실질과세를 하기에 일반적으로 국내에 페이퍼컴퍼니를 세우는 데 이점이 없다면서도 역외 탈세를 위해 해외에 세우는 페이퍼컴퍼니와 이번 같은 경우가 똑같다고 볼 수는 없지만 여러 정황을 봤을 때 비슷한 측면이 있다고 말했다.에스에스컴텍에 따르면 김수현 폰 판매시 레노버 그룹 스마트폰 부문 자회사 북경신기공장과기로부터 대당 위안의 수수료 수입이 발생하게 된다. 이 중 에스에스컴텍이 만원을 갖고 나머지는 한류스타폰이 가져가게 된다.에스에스컴텍은 이 사업으로 총 억원의 순이익을 낼 수 있을 것으로 내다보고 있다.에스에스컴텍은 연결기준 년 억원 년 억원 등 년 연속 순손실을 기록하며 지난해 기준 결손금이 억원을 넘어서는 등 재무구조가 크게 악화된 상태다.문제는 자회사 케이스타폰 실적은 에스에스컴텍 연결 재무제표에 반영되는 반면 지분관계가 없는 협력사 형태인 한류스타폰의 실적은 확인이 안 될 가능성이 크다는 점이다.현재 한류스타폰이 에스에스컴텍의 페이퍼컴퍼니로 의혹을 사고 있는 만큼 신규자금이 향후 어떤 식으로 활용될지 장담할 수 없어 이같은 방식을 택한 데는 다른 의도가 있는 것 아니냐는 지적도 나온다.익명을 요구한 연구기관 전문가는 같은 사업을 추진했던 자회사를 두고 실체가 모호한 또 다른 협력사를 통해 사업을 진행하는 것은 다른 의도가 있을 가능성이 높아 보인다며 굳이 그런 게 아니라면 이런 형태로 거래를 할 필요가 없지 않겠느냐고 말했다.그러나 에스에스컴텍 측은 에스에스컴택 전재석 대표와 레노버 측 대표가 서로 아는 사이라며 둘의 관계로 인해 이번 사업이 성사된 것이라고 설명했다.그러면서도 한류스타폰 측 연락처를 문의하자 양측 경영진 사이에서 비밀리에 진행하는 사업이기에 알려줄 수가 없다고 거절했다.... 세상에 이런일이  동성애 남성에 수면제 탄 음료수 먹이고 오늘의 핫 포토  현실엔 이런 여자 없나요중국 미녀 로봇 화제 뉴시스 뉴스 이젠 네이버 뉴스 스탠드에서도 만나세요 손 안에서 보는 세상 모바일 뉴시스저작권자 공감언론 뉴시스통신사. 무단전재재배포 금지.

It is a kind of special edition product. However, S S Comtech, which was said to have hit the jackpot with Kim Soo-hyun's phone, was suspended from stock trading on the last day due to a creditor's filing for bankruptcy. Furthermore, it was pushed to the brink of expulsion after receiving a rejection of the audit opinion in the first half of the year. According to the Financial Supervisory Service of Japan, S Comtech received all audit opinions rejected on the separate and consolidated audit reports for the first half of the year. The consolidated sales for the first half of the year were 100 million won and the operating loss was 100 million won. Samjong Accounting Firm stated the reason for not carrying out the review procedure for related party transactions. Monthly subsidiary K Star Phone announced that it would launch Kim Soo-hyun phone in partnership with Beijing Shinki Factory Technology Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Keyeast Lenovo, Kim Soo-hyun's agency. He also added an explanation that about 10,000 won in commission income is generated every time the unit is sold. Mr., who had a relationship with Lenovo, persuaded Keyeast, and it was a business structure in which S Comtech took on the role. SComtech, whose largest shareholder changed to Samsoo Holdings last month, was just looking for a new business.

According to SComtech's semiannual report, it is not confirmed that S S Comtech will acquire a stake in the Hallyu Star Phone. Also, SComtech's announcement related to the sale of Kim Soo-hyun's phone, released last month, seems to be significantly different from reality. According to market research firm Counterpoint Research, Lenovo sold 10,000 smartphones per month in the Chinese market. In fact, SComtech's announcement is highly likely to be false. It is analyzed that the sluggish sales of Kim Soo-hyun's phone are due to the fact that related contents were loaded on the old model Juke, which was released last month. S Comtech's stock price soared to KRW in last month's expectations for a jackpot. The stock price was won based on the closing price of the last day just before the transaction suspension.

An NSV official said that after signing a re-audit contract with Samil Accounting Corporation on the last month, he said that he faithfully carried out the implementation items during the improvement period granted by the Korea Exchange and submitted an expert opinion to the accounting firm. After the transaction was suspended last year due to the loss of the corporate seal book, SV was given an improvement period until the following month.

65,"Appointment of ex-CEO Jin Chae-hyun as acting director Success in turning to black in the quarter, expected to resume monthly trading As the dispute over management rights of NSV, a KOSDAQ-listed company, entered a sealing phase, re-audit work to resume trading also accelerated. In the last quarter, expectations for the resumption of trading are rising, such as recording a profit for the first time in a year. NSV announced that former CEO Jin Chae-hyun has restored his acting position as CEO. This is the result of winning the injunction lawsuit filed against Director Joo Ho-hyeon by a person other than CEO Jin. The board of directors held a board meeting at a coffee shop in downtown Seoul on the last day of last month and passed the agenda to dismiss CEO Jin and appoint the main director as the new CEO. In the process, when there was a lack of a quorum, he called Shin Hyo-geun, another inside director, and asked him if he would like to change the representative, then wrote the minutes of the board of directors and applied for registration. In order for the board of directors to be established, they must make decisions through mutual exchange of opinions and attend the entire process from the opening of the meeting. It is highly likely that the re-audit work of Samil Accounting Firm, scheduled for the middle of next month, will proceed normally as Director Jin recovers his position as CEO. NSV was given an improvement period from the Korea Exchange after trading was suspended last year due to loss of the corporate seal book. After re-audit, trading can be resumed if it passes the review of the Korea Exchange. In particular, the successful turnaround in the last quarter is expected to act as a positive factor.

72,"Sehan NSV Audit Opinion Rejection Requirements for Delisting Audit Opinion Limited Audit Report Suspension and Expulsion Crisis of BNC Company Even when allegations of embezzlement and breach of trust were revealed during the audit process, the submission of audit reports for monthly settlement companies listed on the domestic stock market was closed. This year, some listed companies, including Sehan NSV, received their opinions rejected by external auditors, and some failed to submit audit reports by the deadline. There are also listed companies that have been found guilty of embezzlement during an audit. Stock market experts urged companies to take a conservative approach with regard to the submission of an audit report, which is one of the important criteria for deciding whether or not to exit a listed company insolvent. Sehan NSV did not receive an audit opinion from an external auditor. The Korea Exchange explained that it would proceed with the delisting procedure if there is no objection, saying that it is the reason for delisting according to the manufacturing regulations of the KOSDAQ market listing. With Accounting Firm, an external auditor of Sehan NSV, explained the reason for refusing the opinion that the audit procedure could not be performed, saying that the reliability of the internal accounting management system was seriously damaged. In addition to this, Korea Pacific Ship Investment Company, as well as Korea Hohoho, are expected to be expelled from the domestic stock market as their audit opinion is rejected. BNC Company submitted an audit report on the last day, but Hanshin Accounting Firm, the auditor, gave a limited opinion due to the limitation of the scope of the audit, saying that it could not obtain audit evidence on the possibility of recovering short-term loans to specific clients and the performance of investment assets. When a violation of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes occurs, it undergoes a substantive examination of eligibility for listing on the Korea Exchange. KSP filed a complaint with the Busan District Prosecutor's Office over a 100 million won accusation of breach of trust against the former CEO. Winova sued the finance director on suspicion of embezzlement worth KRW 100 million. The exchange has designated Winova as the subject of a substantive examination for listing eligibility. Failure to adequately explain in the substantive examination may result in expulsion from the stock market. Delay in submitting a report is an excuse for exclusion of small and medium-sized stocks to be evacuated. Auditors often insist on conservative accounting treatment, so there are cases where there is a big difference from the performance through internal settlement. One of the reasons for delisting is the fact that there is an operating loss for consecutive years. An exchange official advised that external auditors should submit an audit report to the company at least one week before the regular general meeting of shareholders, and that they should be careful when investing when submission of the audit report is delayed. Regarding the opinions of external auditors, listed companies that led to delisting exceeded the total number of open companies. As such, the KOSDAQ market slump continues as the advisory for insolvent companies falls. This is because small and mid-cap stocks are perceived to be relatively less stable than large-cap stocks, and the reason for delisting is stricter than that of the stock market, so investors are reluctant to invest. If a KOSDAQ-listed company receives an opinion that limits the scope of the audit, it leads to delisting, but a listed company on KOSPI ends up being designated as a management item. One small-cap analyst said that even malicious rumors related to the audit report could be an excuse for a sell-off. Reproduction and redistribution prohibited"

74,"SJK BNC Company J Stephan Woojeon Sehan NSV Seven Star Works S S Comtech What do the listed companies have in common? The point is that all of them are listed on the KOSDAQ market, which has recently received a refusal or limitation of an audit opinion that is the reason for delisting. According to the KOSDAQ listing regulations, only companies with an appropriate audit opinion can maintain listing status. If you receive negative comments or restrictions on rejection of opinions, you may be kicked out of the KOSDAQ market, which has been difficult to enter. The point is that the company name has changed recently or in the last year or so. The old name of SJK is Sejin Electronics. The company changed its name to Mon Sun this year. BNC Company was changed from Goldstar Tech to the current company name on the 1st of this month. Sewoo Tech was transformed into J Stefan five months ago. Woojeon & Handan and NSV also replaced their signboards with Woojeon Sehan NSV respectively last year. The former name of Seven Star Works was TV Logic S S Comtech, and the former name of Yuwon Comtech. The reasons for changing the company name are all the same. I am not trying to talk about the case of Jinx, a KOSDAQ company, in which the company changed its name and the crisis of delisting approached in order to improve the company image and lay a foothold for another leap forward. Most likely the opposite is the case. It is sometimes sad to see a listed company in crisis struggling to survive and even changing its company name. This is because the beautiful expression of enhancing the company image has often been a cover to hide the negative image of the company in the past. For example, in the case of Materials, which changed the company name last year, the founder of Materials There is a bar. Jinsu Kang, who founded the company, was once known as a tycoon in the scrap metal industry. However, he committed fraudulent acts, such as issuing false bonds by inflating affiliate sales, and ended up being judged by the law. After that, the company changed its name. Hantop, a flour manufacturing company, was also replaced with the current name from Yeongnam Flour in 2011. Yeongnam Flour is a company that made headlines after the president's wife's murder of a female college student. Former Chairman Ryu Won-ki's wife, Mr. Yoon, was sentenced to life in prison for ordering her contract murder for suspecting the relationship between her son-in-law and her cousin's sister-in-law. It's not something you can see with your sunglasses on. Also, there will be no problems with all KOSDAQ listed companies changing the company name. However, many experiences in the past warn us to pay close attention to the background of the name change. Investors should not ignore this. There is nothing to lose by being careful and careful in the KOSDAQ market.."

The Korean economy has exclusively obtained a list of companies that have not submitted an audit report. So far, it has been revealed that all of the stocks are on the brink of delisting. Reporter Hae-rin Park Reporter. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME), which recently agreed to receive an additional trillions of won in support from the state-run bank, has opened the way for revival, but has been placed on the list of companies concerned about delisting. Looking at the list of companies that did not submit an audit report obtained by the Korean economy, all companies failed to submit the list within the deadline. In the case of the stock market, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering and other companies were included in the list. Heavy Industries & Construction and Sambu Engineering & Construction were excluded from this deadline due to the fact that they are corporations because the rehabilitation process is in progress. As for the KOSDAQ, companies that are more than twice as large as the stock market failed to submit their audit reports within the deadline. Failure to do so may lead to delisting. Next, listed companies that have a reason for delisting according to the audit opinion will come to KOSDAQ. Among KOSDAQ listed companies, Sehan NSV is the first to face a risk of expulsion. Weed Accounting Firm, in charge of NSV's audit, notified us of refusal of opinion, saying that the credibility of the internal accounting management system was undermined. As a result of the audit, the company received a rejection of opinions, and BNC Company, Rechem, etc. were at a crossroads for delisting due to limited opinions of the apostles. In the case of securities, Kochi received an audit opinion rejected, but Heavy Industry and Nexolon, which did not submit an audit report, were also included here. And Heavy Industry Nexolon The reason for delisting occurred due to total capital encroachment. Interview Lee Jong-bok, Disclosure Team Leader, KOSDAQ Market Headquarters, Korea Exchange Corporations that have been delisted due to refusal of an audit opinion are highly likely to lead to delisting in the future. Even if it is, it is not enough for these corporations to be normalized. Because it takes time, caution is required when investing. Listed companies that enter the stock market through an IPO are more important than other companies, unlike general companies. There were not many cases. Experts say that investors need to be more careful than ever. This is Park Hae-rin, the Korean economy."

80,"Investors are struggling with frequent changes in rights offerings by KOSDAQ listed companies. In particular, investors need to be careful because if the stock price that has risen due to the delay in payment falls, investors may incur large losses. . Among them, the companies that notified the change due to the revision of the description accounted for the majority of cases. The change of the payment date is because the company or corporation that has decided to pay the payment is delaying the payment. receive However, if the payment date is delayed due to unavoidable circumstances, the regulation is not applied. Until last year, only when the capital increase is finally withdrawn, it is designated as an object of inappropriate disclosure of recognition as a reversal of disclosure.

Representative companies that disclose changes are Sehan NSV DMT Samwon Tech Signal Entertainment. Last year, Sehan NSV announced a capital increase of 100 million won. However, the capital increase was delayed one by one as correction announcements were made every time the payment was due. In the meantime, the stock price fell to the won. An official in the financial investment industry said that some insolvent companies took advantage of the blind spot in the system to delay the payment schedule for a long time after announcing a large-scale paid-in capital increase, thereby exacerbating the damage to investors.

154,"Monthly settlement corporation Submit an audit report on life-or-death companies by the end of the month Lately check the company's total capital erosion Check whether the KOSDAQ is in a loss for consecutive years Every month is the month when a lot of companies are being delisted. This is because the deadline for monthly settlement companies to submit audit reports is the end of the month. About the companies that are decommissioned for a year are finalized during this period. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully examine whether the company in which you invested has properly issued an audit report, whether the state of capital erosion has improved, or whether it has recorded a loss for a consecutive year. This year's audit report By the month of submission According to the Act on External Audit of the Korea Exchange and Corporations, companies with monthly accounts must submit last year's audit report no later than the next day. This is because of the regulation that the audit report must be submitted before the week of the regular general meeting of shareholders. This year is a leap year with months to days, so the deadline for submitting the audit report has been delayed by one day compared to last year. Whether or not an audit report has been issued. Whether to submit an audit report can be checked through the electronic disclosure of the Financial Supervisory Service or the corporate disclosure channel operated by the Korea Exchange. As a major reference indicator for investors, the Korea Exchange opens a pop-up window on the corporate disclosure channel site to provide data on the status of non-submission of audit reports. In general, companies that do not submit audit reports within the deadline are highly likely to be insolvent. This is because there are many cases in which companies whose financial condition has deteriorated due to poor performance, such as sales or operating profit, or investment in debt guarantees, delay the submission of audit reports one day after another. Over the past year, all companies have been closed, but all of the companies that have been closed due to the settlement of accounts are all open companies. Capital Encroachment Check Last month, in just one day, all companies including Ultra Construction, Gyeongnam Enterprises, Samhwan Enterprises, and Shinil Construction, etc. were confirmed to be decommissioned. This is because, as a result of submitting the audit report, it was confirmed that the entire capital was eroded. When the total capital encroachment is finally confirmed, the amortization is also confirmed. As of today, companies with high risk of capital erosion include Dongbu Steel, POSCO Plantec, Core Logic, Sambu Construction, and Samsung Engineering. Among them, Samsung Engineering has been suspended from trading since the last day. On the other hand, the general analysis is that the possibility of resolving capital erosion is high. This is thanks to self-rescue efforts such as Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, investing about 100 million won in the capital increase carried out to solve the capital erosion. Dongbu Steel is in danger of being delisted as its capital has been eroded as of the end of last year. Dongbu Steel needs about KRW 100 million to avoid capital erosion, but the creditors have decided to meet next week to discuss the issue of converting about KRW 100 million into equity. The major shareholders of Dongbu Steel are Korea Development Bank, Nonghyup Bank, and Shinhan Bank. POSCO Plantec, which is in a state of complete capital erosion, has been suspended from trading since last month, Core Logic and Sambu Construction from last month. Outside, the stocks designated as management stocks with a capital erosion rate exceeding , include Dongbu Construction Yonghyeon and GMP Daeyang Metal IDES Parkan Taihan Electric Wire Heavy Industry Engine Codes Combine. It is subject to the closing requirements. Annual deficit is designated as a management item, and annual deficit is normalized. This is a rule that does not exist in the KOSPI market.

186,"It was found that a significant number of listed companies that did not receive the external auditor's report and disagreed with the auditor for most of consecutive years received negative evaluations, such as refusal of opinions. According to the report, among monthly settlement companies, listed companies that did not meet the deadline for submitting audit reports in accordance with the External Audit Act were counted as individuals, including KOSPI, KOSDAQ, and KONEX. In accordance with the External Audit Act, listed corporations are usually required to submit and disclose an audit report to the Financial Supervisory Service at least one week before the regular general shareholders' meeting. However, these companies submitted submissions for as short as a day or longer than a week. The reason for the delay in submission of audit reports is usually that they did not receive an audit report from an external auditor or conflict with the auditor over the details of the audit. . In particular, among listed companies that delayed submission of audit reports, some received negative opinions, such as refusal of opinions. Among KOSPI-listed companies, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) received a limited judgment due to limited scope of audit. Among KOSDAQ-listed companies, Dasan Networks and Haengnam Household & Health Care Limited Nanos and Alpha Holdings limited Suncore Semiconlite IE due to limited audit scope were rejected. Among KONEX listed companies, BioProtech received limited opinions. In the KOSPI market, if it receives an opinion with limited audit scope, it is designated as a management item. In the KOSDAQ and KONEX markets, limited audit scope or rejection of opinions is immediately grounds for delisting. However, a listed company that receives a negative opinion can file an objection within one week. In the stock market, among listed companies that submitted an audit report late, there were differences between those that received appropriate opinions and those that received negative opinions such as limited opinions. Signal Entertainment After receiving an appropriate opinion, the group and Suntech DNA Link's stock prices soared from the previous day. On the other hand, stock trading of Suncore Semicon Light I.E. was suspended due to rejection of opinions. Suncore and I.I plan to resolve the reason for refusal of the audit opinion by next month. A Suncore official said that the delinquency issue at the Korea Development Bank was the biggest obstacle, but they discussed a way to resolve the delinquency over the past several days. The official said that he would submit it. The official said that he had caused concern to shareholders and investors, and explained that he plans to file an objection as soon as possible and change the audit opinion to an appropriate one.

187,"Rejection of opinion Linksuntech Signal Entertainment, which is late to maintain the listing of Semiconlite iSuncore, is divided between listed companies that submitted audit reports only after they all exceeded the set limit. Companies that received an appropriate audit opinion can breathe a sigh of relief, but those with negative audit opinions are in a position to worry about delisting right away. Investors who were holding the company's stock due to unexpected bad news also had their feet caught on fire. According to the disclosure system of the Korea Exchange in Japan, companies that have submitted audit reports in the past week have been on the KOSDAQ market, including Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (KOSDAQ). These include the listed DNA Link Botabio Semicon Light Suncore Suntech Signal Entertainment Group I.E.Soft. The submission of the audit report was delayed until the deadline for submitting the audit report was well past the last date. In the stock market, these companies have been concerned by delays in their audit report spending. The stock price has been falling over the past week. Announcing the audit opinion of an external auditor, although belatedly, market concerns have been calmed down. The uncertainty of the audit has been resolved, but the joys and sorrows differ sharply depending on the content of the audit report. First of all, companies that received an appropriate audit opinion and escaped from concerns about delisting also saw their stock prices soar, sweeping their hearts. DNA Link is the type of person who only submitted an audit report after 1 p.m. As investor concerns became severe, the stock price closed at the lower limit on the day of the market. However, on the news that it had received an appropriate opinion, the stock price hit the upper limit the next day. Signal Entertainment Group and Suntech, which issued an audit report with an appropriate opinion at the same time, also raised their respective stock prices at the same time. is putting In the stock market, if a listed company receives a limited opinion, it is designated as a management item and does not lead to immediate delisting. We received limited opinions due to the limited scope of the audit, because the financial sector does not provide financial support like Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering does. In addition, abnormal capital erosion occurred in the capital, and in the end, it was designated as a management item. The stock price plunged more than one day when trading was resumed. Semiconlight Suncore I.E. issued an audit report, but accepted the refusal of the audit opinion. The response from the market is that they have been receiving attention in the KOSDAQ market due to issues such as financing or entering new businesses. Investors are pounding with their feet as trading is suspended immediately after the announcement of the audit report. Even though Botabio received an appropriate audit opinion, its share price continued to decline as external auditors raised significant doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern. The additional reasons for the designation of a management item were that the foreign capital erosion rate was higher than the foreign capital erosion rate and there was a continuation of business loss before deduction of corporate tax expenses in the business year in excess of equity capital during the recent business year. . Semiconlite and I.E. can file an objection within one day from the date of receiving the notice of delisting. If there is no objection, the delisting procedure will be followed. In the case of Suncore, as the opinion was rejected due to uncertainty about the going concern ability, the remaining method is to submit a confirmation of resolution of the reason by the same auditor until the next day. Failure to submit a confirmation letter is the same as the reason for delisting. Companies at risk of delisting have begun filing complaints against shareholders, announcing an objection. AiE said that it was notified of the rejection of the audit opinion on the grounds that appropriate audit evidence was not available for some investment cases, and plans to file an objection. A company official said, ""The business is active in the game business and mobile advertising marketing field and funds are being managed smoothly,"" he said. Suncore plans to prove that it is possible to become a going concern by solving the problems of late payment of employees' wages and delinquency of the main bank, Korea Development Bank, which are the reasons for refusal of opinion. Since the audit report is not submitted by the month, it is designated as a management item from the month and the reason for delisting occurs after a few days. However, there is an opinion that the possibility of delisting is not high due to the delay of the external audit report of Dasan Zone Solutions, a Nasdaq listed company that it acquired last year. Kim Hong-sik, a researcher at Hana Financial Investment, said that the worst possibility of refusal of an audit opinion or a substantive review of listing qualifications should be kept open, but the delay in this audit report is only a simple happening and it is difficult to see it as a company insolvency.

Looking at the distribution of sales during the period, large listings in the Won range stand out from the current price, and among them, Won is the line for the entire transaction, and the trading price is relatively large in this price range. Because there is a need and the won's sale price is also large, it can act as a resistance zone when the stock price rises in the future. Therefore, in the current situation where the stock price is undergoing a short-term correction, it is reasonable to place more weight on the resistance of the won, which is the selling price.

248,"Kim Byung-kwon, former CEO of Steel Flower, delayed public announcement for months... Reporter Kang Hyun-chang, in a situation where POSCO's investment would be lost. POSCO, which has invested about 100 million won in the company, said that it did not know about the loan contract. Most of the investment is in danger of being blown away. Steelflower, a pipe company, announced on the day that former CEO Kim Byung-kwon, who was a major shareholder, borrowed 100 million won from Sejong Savings Bank last month using 10,000 shares of his own stock as collateral. It has been delayed for months. Former CEO Kim resigned from the position of chairman by the resolution of the board of directors last month. After resigning from management, he did not disclose the fact of his equity-secured loans for over a month, and most of Kim's shares had already been sold in the opposite direction. Last day, Steel Flower announced that CEO Kim's stake fell to . by selling Manchuria shares secured by Sejong Savings Bank as collateral. I couldn't figure it out. Currently, Steelflower does not have any shareholders with ideals. POSCO, the new major shareholder, also owns only . Last year, POSCO participated in the capital increase through self-allocation of Steel Flower and invested KRW 100 million to secure a stake. Since he did not participate in a total of three rights offerings in the following year, his stake dropped to .. Steelflower's current financial situation is serious. It has been designated as a management item since it recorded an operating loss for the last five business years. The operating loss on a consolidated basis last quarter amounted to KRW 100 million. The accumulated deficit for the first half of the year is about 100 million won. As the change of the largest shareholder became known, the Korea Exchange recently designated Steel Flower as the subject of a substantive review of listing qualifications. The stock has been suspended from trading since last day. Changes in the majority shareholder of a managed item are subject to a listing qualification substantive examination. The exchange will determine whether Steel Flower is subject to a listing qualification examination during the trading day and, if it is concluded that it is subject to examination, it will proceed with a delisting examination. If Steel Flower is delisted If this happens, POSCO's investment will also end in failure. At the time of the bequest in which POSCO participated, the issuance price of Steel Flower's new shares was 10,000 won per share, but the current share price is just a coin share in KRW.
