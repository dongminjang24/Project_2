"Epivalry, a backlight unit company, announced in a public announcement that it has received approval from the Ulsan District Court for the rehabilitation plan. Epivally applied for rehabilitation procedures last month and received a decision to start the month.Accordingly, a large reduction is carried out, and the capital of 10,000 shares issued becomes 100 million won. In addition, creditors such as Kookmin Woori Shinhan Bank will be provided with a paid-in capital increase in the allocation of students in Manchuria to convert their investments. The date of listing of new shares is next month.The largest shareholder will also be changed from Cho Joo-hwan to Kookmin Bank. Epi Valley's sales and net profit last year were 100 million won and 100 million won, respectively. The rehabilitation plan was approved. What are your plans for the future? The management plan for the next year has been approved. The contents of strengthening security rights and repayment of bonds were approved. There is also a part about. Some say the target is Dongbu Group. As for Eastern Group, yes or no, I can't confirm. In fact, there is nothing going on. I have been talking to people who are interested in Epi Valley, whether in the east or anywhere. Nothing was specifically discussed with the subjects, but in the meantime, an article named Dongbu Group was published. It's not going to work this way. What can be said is that there is a company that is interested and that if they take over, they will go through the process. Apart from the rehabilitation plan, it will proceed whether it is an open sale or not. is an option. The performance has not been good for years. Is there any particular reason? As you know, the business was very bad. The sector has a high proportion of cost goods, which rose a lot last year. In addition, financial costs were also high due to more debt than overall sales. Financial costs have been under pressure for a long time, and sales have fallen due to the bad business conditions. In the end, they couldn't handle interest, let alone repay the loan, so they ended up going through rehabilitation procedures. It also sold its affiliates Sungil INT and its Chinese subsidiary early last year, but it didn't help. The sale helped the company's finances. However, the business was fundamentally difficult and the pressure was high. Companies that go into rehabilitation procedures are usually in a similar situation. The cash flow is bad. Our main cause was the pressure on borrowing. It was selected as one of the best new growth engines in Korea. Honestly, everyone had a good view of the business situation until the middle of the year. So did big companies like Samsung. The lights were good. No one really expected it to get this bad right now. I have been raising capital several times, but it has become difficult. Of course, the biggest thing is that we didn't expect the business to get this bad. Can't we confirm that Dongbu Group has started? I can't even confirm if it's one of them. Lastly, if you could say a word about the future of Epi Valley. Although it is difficult, it has been approved for the rehabilitation plan and I think Epi Valley has a chance to revive. So far, it has been difficult due to financial costs, but I think creditors have shown full support and given them a chance again. We will also make sure to repay existing bonds smoothly and generate profits. It is absolutely possible to do so. I'm also sorry that our investors lost a lot of money due to large-scale potatoes. We will find ways to minimize damage to existing shareholders.Reporter Lee Jae-Yoo...Korea's popular i-dot-com article, ""I'm wearing an offshore Mercedes-Benz.

"Many listed companies that have been on the verge of being kicked out due to massive losses from affiliates are on the verge of being kicked out of the company by acquiring stakes in other companies to continue the crisis of exit due to the insolvency of Insprite affiliates.According to the Japanese industry, Inspreet was selected as a software global star fostering company selected by the government last year, but it was pushed to the edge of the cliff because it could not handle the massive loss of its subsidiary. Inspreet, which received an inappropriate audit opinion as an auditor, will be delisted if it fails to submit a confirmation of the resolution of the reason by the coming day.In fact, according to the Inspirit audit report, net loss of KRW 100 million was incurred due to losses of equity investment companies, and the total amount of equity capital was KRW 100 million as of the end of the reporting period. Under these circumstances, it is expressed that the company is questioning its viability as a continuing company.Insprit is a company that has been recognized for its technology in related industries to supply network infrastructure solutions to all domestic mobile carriers such as Telecom U+.However, as part of business diversification last year, the acquisition of Nexilion, a semiconductor design company, through its subsidiary Inbricks became a source of trouble. By adding competitiveness to the existing Internet phone business and presenting a blueprint to form a multimedia solution and Android platform into one chip, it merged Inbrix and Nexillion and changed its name to NSPERT.The expected synergy did not appear. The tablet, which NSPERT ambitiously introduced, also did not draw much response in the market. NSpurt recorded a net loss of KRW 100 million last year and fell into a state of capital erosion. In other words, attempts to diversify have led to the decline of Inspirit as well as Nspurt.The company is also suspected of accounting fraud as well as taking on the aftermath of its affiliates, Eoulim Networks and Eoulim Information Technology. Tong Yang Telecom's loss on disposal of investment assets was also cited as the main reason for the increase in net losses.Although it is not in the process of delisting, KDC is also one of the listed companies suffering from worsening performance of related companies that invested in diversification. KD's net loss, which achieved sales of 100 million won last year, amounts to 100 million won.As its affiliate Ice Station recorded a large net loss, it also adversely affected KDC's financial statements. Ice Station, which recorded a net loss of KRW 100 million last year, is in a state of complete capital erosion and is on the verge of delisting.KD, which used to be a theater-oriented stereoscopic image business, acquired Ice Station, a portable multimedia player company, last year to expand stereoscopic images in the mobile terminal sector. Last year, I thought Ice Station had a synergy effect by developing tablets with the support of KD, but it did not lead to improved performance.Stock market experts said efforts to diversify businesses for sustainable growth are bound to continue, but advised listed companies with a lot of practical control should be looked more closely because there are many cases of failure due to excessive investment.An analyst at Smallcap explained, ""The introduction of new accounting standards often reveals previously unknown insolvency,"" adding, ""We need to carefully examine the consolidated audit report before deciding on investment.""Park Hyung-soo, the largest shareholder of Insprit, is over-the-counter in Manchuria Anytime and Anywhere in your life Smart Economic Daily News Real-time News and Financial Markets in Stock Transactions E Daily Market Point.

"Ahead of the announcement of negative content, there have been a series of cases in which key officials of the company sell their shares. They sold their shares a few days before announcing that they had been rejected by an audit opinion, and disposed of their shares just before they were designated as management items.Insprit's largest shareholder signed a contract on the last day to transfer its own shares and management rights. However, in just two days, it was revealed that Inspirit was inappropriately received as an audit opinion. As a result, Insprit will be able to avoid being kicked out only after resolving inappropriate reasons by this month.Insprit also started selling its stake in the troubled subsidiary. Insprit sold its shares in Enspert, which it owned, in the market this month. Two days later, news of Nspert's worsening financial structure was reported, and 10 days later, bad news was announced that Nspert received an inappropriate audit opinion.One of the special officials of GIA Bio's largest shareholder has sold all of his shares in the market several times this year. The special official completed the disposal of shares a week before GIA Bio was designated as a management item.The largest shareholder of Korea General Corporation, which was designated as a management item this month, sold Manchuria over-the-counter a month before the news of the designation of a management item was announced. Earlier this month, a major investor in Korea General Corp. also sold most of its shares, lowering its stake from .An official from the KOSDAQ industry pointed out that it is highly likely that the largest shareholders and related parties were aware of signs of worsening management as they were relatively advantageous to understand the company's internal situation.A researcher at a local securities firm said, ""Even though the sale of shares by company officials is a simple disposal, ordinary shareholders who watch the sale are relatively deprived,"" adding, ""We need to supervise whether they started selling shares using internal information.""I've had enough of the hot news of Chosun BizIt turns out that the reason why Hyundai Samsung's all-out war Valentine's year is expensive is because it is increasing consumption despite the soaring oil prices due to the provocation of Toyota and the habit of Hyundai Motor."

"Just before the suspension of the sale, major shareholders sold their shares in bulk just before INSPRIT, a KOSDAQ-listed company, and its subsidiary NSPERT were on the verge of delisting together. The Korea Exchange is investigating allegations that major shareholders of these companies are eating and running. Inspreet is a company that attracted attention as former Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Ki-tae invested 100 million won.Recently, the Korea Exchange's market watchdog has been investigating allegations of unfair trade practices against Insprit and Nspert. The focus of the investigation is whether related parties, including the largest shareholder and the CEO, knew in advance that bad news would come out and sold their stakes in advance.Nspert conducted a series of paid-in capital increase for months from last month. In the meantime, Insprit, the largest shareholder, lowered its stake in Nspert from a large amount of in-house selling to . Enspert President Chun Bo-moon and Inspirit President Lee Chang-seok also sold Manchuria and Manchuria in the market earlier this year, respectively, at the short-term highs of KRW and KRW per share. NSpurt, which caused the delisting due to improper audit opinions on the entire capital, has been suspended from trading at Won.Insprit also had a reason for delisting due to improper audit opinions. President Lee Chang-seok, the largest shareholder, signed a management transfer contract on the last day, but invalidated the contract because the deposit was not deposited. Before and after this, President Lee announced that he sold Manchuria over-the-counter.As Inspreet is on the verge of delisting, former Vice Chairman Lee is also in trouble. This is because Kader Power, where former Vice Chairman Lee and former Vice Chairman Lee are the largest shareholders, participated in the paid-in capital increase of Insprit.

"It has been confirmed that some of NK Bio's shares, which are under investigation by the prosecution for embezzlement and breach of trust by management, have been provided as collateral for debts of the former largest shareholder. The debtor was an employee of NK Bio until a year ago, and the loan is more than the company's cashable assets.According to the Japanese securities industry and the Financial Supervisory Service, Curious, the largest shareholder of NK Bio, entrusted Shinhan Savings Bank with full shares of NK Bio shares with payment guarantees and collateral for Kim Young-joo, the former largest shareholder.As a result, if Kim fails to repay the loan, NK Bio's shares, which were provided as collateral, will be able to be sold at any time. Kim was the company's largest shareholder until last month when Curious became the largest shareholder of NK Bio.Securities industry officials say they do not readily understand the debt of the largest shareholder in the past has continued to this day, even though it has been several years since the company's owner changed. It is also out of common sense that the amount of collateral provided by Curious for Kim is the level of Curious's total holdings.""An official from the securities industry said, ""All of Curious's remaining holdings are currently provided as collateral,"" adding, ""In the end, all of Curious's holdings are provided as collateral."" In fact, Curious also provided NK Bio's stock manju as collateral to Hanul ST&G.In response, an official from NK Bio said, ""I don't know anything because it happens among the largest shareholders,"" adding, ""It is difficult to confirm the contents at the moment.""Meanwhile, NK Bio said on this month that the Daejeon District Prosecutors' Office is investigating allegations of embezzlement and breach of trust by former and current management.

There is no problem from our own investigation, and we will take care of it as soon as possible. He said that he has been running only for the future of the company since he took the position of CEO in the year and is finally paying off.An official from NK Bio was limited by the auditor despite the appropriateness of the financial statements because he/she omitted information in the audit report that could question whether he/she could survive as a continuing company due to the continuous deficit over the past year.

"Regarding the technology transfer of anticancer immune cell treatments to Japan, NK Bio said that the technology transfer has been completed, but the reproducibility experiment has not yet been completed.An official from NK Bio explained, ""The reproducibility experiment is an equivalence experiment for technology, and we see whether the proportion of cells, survival rate, and cell ability are reproduced in Japan.""The official said that the fact that the balance has not yet been deposited seems to be acting as uncertainty in the market, adding that it is difficult to determine whether the reproducibility test will be completed by the end of this year.Regarding the possibility of being subject to management under the KOSDAQ-related regulations for consecutive years, the official said, ""We fully understand that investors are anxious,"" adding, ""The company is also trying to proceed as soon as possible.""NKBio recorded an operating loss of KRW 100 million last quarter. The accumulated losses amounted to millions of won. Last year, it recorded operating losses of 100 million won in the year and 100 million won in the year.

"Unlike parent companies, ventilation items have not been designated, and KOSDAQ bio company NK Bio, which was limited by audit opinions, avoided designating ventilation items by the Korea Exchange. As the management's embezzlement or audit opinion is the issue that has the greatest impact on the company's existence, some in the securities industry are raising problems with the screening criteria.In addition, Curious, the parent company of NK Bio, was designated as a ventilation item. There are also objections to what the difference is between the two companies.Ventilation stocks announced by the Korea Exchange on the day were all changed, including the opening of management stocks and the opening of non-management stocks. Companies that are not managed items were selected by the Korea Exchange based on its own standards.An official of the exchange said, ""Investors were often kicked out when they were not aware of risks due to strengthening real audit and auditing,"" and explained, ""It is a ventilation item that investors introduced in advance to refer to companies that need transparency in corporate continuity.""In other words, stocks that are likely to be kicked out will be designated as ventilation stocks. International DY IDN & ANC Bio Holdings, which was newly designated this time, is a company with a large cumulative deficit and its largest shareholder has changed several times. Faruna, KDC, Hyundai Ivy, and others are stocks that once soared as theme stocks.However, NKBio avoided designating ventilation. NK Bio is currently investigating allegations of embezzlement and breach of trust at the Daejeon District Prosecutors' Office. In fact, it is known to be due to corruption related to O2 Savings Bank, an affiliate.Moreover, in an audit report late last year, an accounting firm limited its audit opinion, saying that it could not recover assets and repay debts due to normal business processes.An official from Curious said, ""I thought NK Bio would become a ventilation event and Curious would avoid it."" Another official said that NK Bio has either quit on a large scale or is preparing to change jobs after the prosecution's investigation.An official of the KOSDAQ market headquarters' corporate review team explained, ""Even during the embezzlement investigation, the results are mixed depending on what score other items get,"" adding, ""The number of changes to the largest shareholder and the number of false disclosures are all important.""Of course, even though the comprehensive evaluation does not reach the designation of ventilation items in the objective examination process, it cannot be asked to be designated. However, in this case, controversy is expected to continue over whether there is a problem with the allocation of points. In fact, some of the companies designated as ventilation stocks are expressing their position to regain their honor through lawsuits.""Joseon Biz Hot News"" ""Israel I Dig for Cash in the Sea of Death"" shows the price of a fan without wings made in Korea by gamers who are in trouble with their daughter Jung Mong-koo, who is in front of the toilet, making her appearance in a heavenly place."

In addition, expectations for the possibility of insurance coverage of cell therapy drugs under development in Korea are also rising.Meanwhile, NK Bio signed a contract with Medinet, a leading company in the Japanese immune cell treatment market, to transfer the source technology for cell culture, and has also entered the cell treatment business in the Middle East.

"The performance of stem cell bio-related stocks, which were one of the leading themes of the stock market last year, was not cool. Looking at the performance of these themes last quarter, it was confirmed that some stocks had expanded their deficit, while some stocks were feared to be designated as management items.Innocell recorded an operating loss last year. Operating loss recorded over the individual business year after years. It was comforting that the operating loss recorded KRW 100 million, which was smaller than last year. The Korea Exchange said on the past that Innocel may be designated as a management item.Pharmicell is also a stem cell line that has not been followed by its performance. Pharmicell said on the last day that it recorded operating losses of KRW 100 million last year, widening the deficit compared to the previous year. Net loss for the current term also increased to reach 100 million won.All of these stocks more than doubled their stock prices last year due to the bio-stem cell craze. Innocell's stock price, which stayed at Wondae early last year, soared to the latter half of Wondae in the second half of the year. Pharmicell also traded at Wondae early last year and rose to 10,000 won early this year.NK Bio, which produces anti-cancer immune cell treatments, has not yet been announced last year, but has been in the red for years as of last quarter. Nevertheless, daily stock prices soared more than at the end of last year.In response, securities experts say that some of the stem cell bio companies have passed clinical trials or have been confirmed to be effective due to commercialization of products, but special attention is needed because some stocks are soaring due to simple themes.An analyst in charge of pharmaceuticals at a local securities firm pointed out that due to the nature of the pharmaceutical bio industry, funds are injected until results come out, which is why performance is deteriorating, but some stocks soar on simple expectations.Another analyst explained that pharmaceutical bio shares are easy to form a theme because they account for a large proportion of individual trading, especially in some industries where stock prices continue to soar and fall, stock prices tend to be dominated by supply and demand rather than company value.In fact, Innocel's stock price plunged last year due to concerns over a continuous operating deficit in advance. At the time, the company claimed that although it has been in the red continuously due to the cost of R&D clinical trials following large-scale clinical trials that have been conducted since year, it can be converted into a surplus from year.Medipost, one of the leading bio companies in the KOSDAQ market, experienced the pain of falling stock prices close to each other, even though sales and operating profit improved more than last year due to individuals' supply and demand battle.""Song Hye-kyo, Billion Tech Mudbus, Yoo Jae-seok, who pushed out Cho Young-nam Villa of Chosun Biz Hot News, How to Get What You Want to Treat Stars That Will Cry"" The author's Negotiating Law Jobs and Ahn Cheol Soo Machiavelli Who Will Hold Their Hands? iPad Dollar Maginot Line."

"Concerns over designation of surplus management items for the first time in years, such as NK BioCurius, have been eased.Investment fever is hot for listed companies that have returned to life from the brink of investment decisions by grasping the performance improvement trend of experts on the recent rise in stock prices. to record operating losses for years in a row from last year to year Stock prices of listed companies that succeeded in turning into a surplus last year are rising sharply. This is because last year's settlement of accounts eliminated concerns that it could become a management item due to operating losses for consecutive years.However, stock market experts advise that the government should maintain a conservative perspective until it checks whether it can maintain a surplus this year.According to the Japanese securities industry, NKBio has risen in the last two days. During the same period, Curious rose close, and Yedang Company and Terrari Sauce rose respectively for four days.Although they are listed companies with different industries and completely different market capitalization, they have something in common that they succeeded in turning into a surplus after overcoming the sluggishness of the past year.NK Bio recorded operating profit of KRW 100 million last year. As sales increased through technology transfer, the company escaped from the years-long deficit march. In fact, NK Bio recorded sales of 100 million won last year. Compared to the previous year, the scale has increased.Curious succeeded in turning into a surplus with operating profit of KRW 100 million last year, while Yedang and TerrariSource also recorded operating profit of KRW 100 million and KRW 100 million, respectively.It is natural for listed companies aimed at pursuing profits, but last year's operating profit news has a special meaning. It was incorporated as a management item and was able to escape the crisis of restrictions on financing and transactions.Last year, the Financial Services Commission and the Korea Exchange announced a plan to advance the listing system, which calls for the removal of KOSDAQ-listed companies that have suffered operating losses for two consecutive years to weed out marginalized listed companies. According to this, if an operating loss is recorded for consecutive years, it is designated as a management item and if it fails to make a surplus even after a year, it is expelled.Therefore, if NK Bio and others submit a business report that does not deviate significantly from their own tally by the end of this month, they can be free from concerns over designation of management items.An official from NK Bio explained, ""We will maintain a surplus this year by transferring technology overseas and entering the Middle East market."" An official from Yedang also said, ""We were able to make profits thanks to the increase in sales of music and album sales, and various concert performance fees. We will continue to improve our performance by introducing new idol groups this year."" Curious also said it is confident that it will continue its surplus trend as it completed investment in facilities last year.This can be seen as the recent rise in stock prices due to the expectation that it will break the deficit link and maintain its surplus.However, stock market experts advised that hasty predictions should not be made. In particular, some listed companies are under investigation by the prosecution for former and current management, so it is advised that investment should not be decided with only one factor.A small cap analyst said, ""It is difficult to say that we succeeded in improving our constitution just by making profits last year,"" adding, ""It will not be too late to decide whether to invest or not while watching the performance trend until the first half of this year at least.""In addition, the fact that sales were not that large last year should be considered when judging whether or not to invest, adding that the transition to the surplus, which does not involve external growth, is likely to have a one-off factor added.Park Hyungsoo, NK Bio, last year's operating profit...In the middle of a year-on-year investigation, the prosecution is investigating the embezzlement and breach of trust of NK Bio.

"The bio industry, which lost investor confidence along with the Hwang Woo-suk case in the middle of the year. It focuses on analyzing the bio-fever of the stock market whether it can become a mega trend in the stock market due to the new expectations of future growth engines.The heyday of bio shares is unfolding in the KOSDAQ market. Dog bio shares such as Celltrion, Medipost, Seegene, GemVax, Skael, and Chabio& are listed at the top of the KOSDAQ market capitalization.Last year, Macrogen, one of the bio-juho, entered the KOSDAQ market. Years have passed, but the evaluation of bio shares has not changed much in the past and now. Celltrion Chairman Seo Jung-jin, who has a market capitalization of trillion won, also complains that he has been called a fraud countless times. In addition, doubts about the flow of funds and the accounting sector remain.Bio shares are still in the middle of fraud and jackpot. This is because no one can guarantee success until the last minute due to the nature of the bio industry, and evaluation of performance is not simple. In addition, stock prices are constantly soaring due to theme or non-question investment rather than objective performance.However, the management system and business structure of bio companies are evolving, unlike the generation.Recently, entrepreneurs who paid attention to the possibility of success in the bio industry are jumping into start-ups of bio companies. In addition, more and more companies are laying the foundation for stable R&D through business diversification, such as securing cash cow businesses other than bio.All the professionals are here.From researchers to businessmen, thanks to the development of the bio industry as a businessman and the growth of bio companies, businessmen are prominent. From the left, Seo Jung-jin, CEO of Celltrion, Cho Jung-myung, CEO of Crystal Genomics, Hwang Dong-jin, president of Medipost.Celltrion Chairman Seo Jung-jin, who holds the undisputed market capitalization on the KOSDAQ, is a former celery man. His major in college is also industrial engineering, and he has worked at Daewoo Motors and other companies, which has nothing to do with the bio field.After being restructured at the age of mid-20s during the IMF bailout, he opened his eyes to the possibility of the bio industry and developed a company that is recognized for its global competitiveness in the biosimilar sector for the first time in years.Cho Jung-myung, CEO of Crystal Genomics, is also considered one of the representative examples of starting a bio company after leaving a stable job as a former head of the chemical research institute.Recently, among bio companies, founders who are former researchers often recruit professional managers for management instead of focusing on research and development.Yang Yoon-sun, the founder and largest shareholder of Medipost and a doctor at Samsung Medical Center at Sungkyunkwan University, oversees research and development, while Hwang Dong-jin, a former president of the Financial Supervisory Service and former CEO of Macrogen, is taking care of management. Hwang Young-ki, former chairman of Chabio & Co., is also chairman of the CEO.The industry expects that as the development of the bio industry accelerates and the size of bio companies increases, the number of bio companies from businessmen, not researchers, will increase significantly.In addition, the division of labor between R&D and management is expected to become more common in bio companies, given that it can catch two rabbits: stabilizing management and increasing R&D efficiency.Biology is an old saying.Long-term survival strategies due to business diversification Among bio companies that have recently received attention, it is not difficult to find companies that operate not only bio businesses such as stem cells but also other business fields.Medipost recorded sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won in the first half of this year. The hundreds of millions of won in sales was earned through the cord blood business. As a result, it spent hundreds of millions of won on research and development in the first half of the year alone, but it maintains stable management.Cha Bio& not only makes most of its sales through the hospital business, but also runs a mobile phone camera lens module business. In addition, GemVax Co., Ltd., which operates a bio business through its subsidiary CaL GemVax, is a semiconductor display clean room pollution control business and acquired KSCB, a plastic colorant company, last month.The strategy is to lay the groundwork for stable R&D through business diversification due to the nature of the bio industry, which requires large-scale investments for a long time but cannot make profits immediately.Of course, there are many cases where bio companies facing limitations are trying to diversify their businesses through mergers and acquisitions in a hurry to hand over management items or delisting requirements.Many bio companies, including Byromed, A&C Bio Holdings, NK Bio, Isu Abyss, and others, recorded operating losses for years until last year. If it is not a designated company for a new growth engine, it will be immediately incorporated into a management item if it makes an operating deficit for consecutive years.An official from the bio industry pointed out that bio companies have improved their management and business systems compared to the past, but many companies are still facing limitations due to the structure that only costs and produces no profits.

"Reporter Lee Young-jae's bio-medicine-related stocks, which are expected to be customized embryonic stem cell treatments following dendritic cells, faced a double favorable factor.Dr. Ralph Steinman's Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine drew attention to dendritic cell treatments, and U.S. researchers succeeded in creating patient-specific embryonic stem cells.Some biopharmaceutical-related stocks have already started strong gains.In the Japanese KOSDAQ market, NK Bio represents 1,000 won, which has risen to the price limit as of morning. At the same time, Binex and Chinese and foreign new drugs are also soaring, respectively.NK Bio is a company that develops treatments using dendritic cells. Binex and Creagen, a subsidiary of Chinese and foreign new drugs, have been approved by the Korea Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials of dendritic cells.Dr. Steinman's first dendritic cells discovered in this year absorb antigens such as viruses and bacteria and provide the information to the cell surface to induce an immune response.Treatments using dendritic cells are attracting attention in that they can reduce side effects of existing treatments such as body rejection and toxicity.In the United States, a prostate cancer treatment vaccine using dendritic cells was already released last year. In Korea, clinical trials have been completed for some diseases, and treatments are expected to come out soon.Stem cell therapy-related stocks are also on the rise.CHA BIO&. It's going up. Choa Pharmaceutical and Innocell are also on the rise. In the securities market, R&L Bio is trading at 1,000 won, up KRW.The news that U.S. researchers succeeded in making patient-tailored embryonic stem cells that Dr. Hwang Woo-suk tried was a positive factor.Dr. Dieter Ellie of the New York Stem Cell Foundation said in a research paper published in the British scientific journal Nature that he succeeded in obtaining embryonic stem cells by collecting the skin cell nucleus of a test applicant and injecting it into an egg.In Korea, Dr. Hwang announced that he succeeded in making the world's first patient-tailored embryonic stem cells, but some results were found to have been fabricated, causing a stir.The customized embryonic stem cells created by Dr. Ellie are still problematic to use to treat diseases, but they are considered to be an advanced achievement in stem cell research.Stem cell-related stocks, which had been on a strong rise since President Lee Myung Bak announced plans to support stem cell research last month, are once again on the positive side.However, experts stressed that an investment strategy based on meticulous analysis of the potential for corporate growth is needed rather than vague expectations from the news of the development of new technologies.Choi Jong-kyung, a researcher at Investment & Securities, said, ""Bio pharmaceutical-related stocks are sensitive to However, investors said they should take a closer look at the progress of individual companies' research projects and the marketability of treatments.Yonhap News Mobile App Download Photo Magazine Copyright 뉴스 Yonhap News.

"Recently, cautionary voices have been rising over the strong stock prices of domestic bio companies. As some companies' market capitalization has risen to a level similar to that of the world's top companies, they are concerned about an approach that relies on expectations.Bio-related stocks showed a high rise in the volatile market. After the month, Innocent is. R&L Bio is. Medipost has gone up. NK Bio Genexine is also showing a steady rise.Securities experts cite the surge in bio shares as reasons for the favorable policy environment, such as the stock price performance of bio shares that have been listed publicly or indirectly in recent years and the trend to nurture stem cells.In particular, Korean stem cell companies have the largest number of related patents after the U.S., Japan and the U.K., and stem cell stocks have some source technologies in the adult stem cell sector, leading the rise in stock prices.These stem cell companies saw their market capitalization rise to the highest level in the world. According to Daewoo Securities, Chabio & Medipost R&L Bio has the highest market capitalization worldwide in the stem cell sector. On the other hand, Geron's market capitalization, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the first time in human embryonic stem cell clinical trials, is about half of them.Lee Hye-rin, a researcher at Investment & Securities, said, ""The market capitalization of some bio companies exceeds that of U.S. companies that are ahead of the technology of sales and profit,"" adding, ""The high level of KOSDAQ credit balance and fundamentals are not significant.""In addition, as the domestic stem cell market is still only at the level of the global market, it is also a burden that technology should be verified through clinical trials at home and abroad and enter overseas markets at the same time.Kwon Jae-hyun, a researcher at Daewoo Securities, said, ""Korean stem cell companies are highly ranked in the world, so if commercialization and clinical trials are smooth, they can gain competitiveness in overseas markets.""Researcher Kwon added that long-term investment from a conservative perspective is essential, not simply investing in companies under the name of stem cells, but investing while checking the progress of clinical and commercialization.

"Celltrion's Seo Jung-jin, the biggest shareholder in the KOSDAQ market, has suddenly changed its largest shareholder in the past month, including the introduction of hostile, defenseless Medipost gold parachutes. CEO Yang Yoon-sun regained his position as the largest shareholder as Atinum Investment, owned by Atinum Partners Chairman Lee Min-joo, sold about half of its stake in the market. Last month, he gave up his position as the largest shareholder to Allianz Global, a foreign investment company that acquired a stake. The owner of a bio company, which finished clinical trials of knee cartilage treatments and entered the last-minute approval process for the sale of new drugs, has changed three times in the past year.Recently, the stock price of bio companies has been rising. However, it is analyzed that most of them are exposed to hostile corporate mergers and acquisitions as their largest shareholders are only inside and outside.The increase in valuation gains has led to a surge in bio-related stocks due to the commercialization of stem cell treatments by the bright dog SalguefC B Pharmicell. The valuation gains of startup owners of bio companies are also snowballing. GemVax shares rose from 10,000 won to 10,000 won at the end of last month. GemVax CEO Kim Tae-kyun's valuation gain also increased by 100 million won. R&L Bio Chairman Ra Jung-chan also saw his stock value increase by 100 million won. Kim Hyun-soo, CEO of FCB2wellb and CEO Yang of Medipost, who started the bioju rally with the development of stem cell treatments, also have a valuation gain of 100 million won and 100 million won during the same period.Evaluation profits are increasing, but they are also worried. That is a weak equity structure. Their shareholding ratio is in and out. That's what happened because R&D funds were allocated through capital increase without any cash cow. Owners of not only Medipost but also Macrogen NK Bio, Innocell, R&L Bio, Crystal Jinomix, and Cha Bio&n immediately became a hot topic to attract friendly investors, let alone realize profits.Bio companies, which have more money to spend than they have to spend on unstable hostile exposure, do not have many ways to stop hostile behavior. The stake will inevitably fall as it cannot afford to increase its stake in the largest shareholder and has to rely on capital increase such as convertible bonds in the future.GemVax, which is conducting clinical trials of a pancreatic cancer vaccine in the UK, issued and attracted $10,000 in investment from an American investment company.

The system forces new largest shareholders to pay billions of won in consolation money per person in addition to severance pay if they dismiss existing directors.FCB2well changed its articles of association late last year to make it virtually impossible to dismiss a director when the approval of a new drug was imminent. In order for the dismissal of directors, including the CEO, to be passed, the consent of the shareholders attending the general shareholders' meeting was required. Despite these efforts, the stock market believes that hostile acts against bio companies can be attempted at any time.Reporters Son Seong-tae, Roh Kyung-mok, a free health lecture-guided stem cell discovery, will be given a new gene, and the meaning and prospects of the first stem cell therapy per month"

"As shares of StemScience, a medical bio company, poured into the market through counter-selling, attention is being paid to whose shares are for sale. This is because the volume of counter-trading is higher than that of the largest shareholder.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Shinhan Savings Bank sold all of StemScience shares, which have the right to dispose of collateral shares, at an average won on the last day. This is equivalent to . of the total issued shares of StemScience.StemScience's stock price rose to its original level in early last month, but began to fall as the push for a small merger with Kyung Hee Pharmaceutical, an affiliate with a stake, fell through and was incorporated into ventilation stocks. At that time, StemScience failed to resolve the objection filed by Kyung Hee Pharmaceutical creditors and finally terminated the merger contract.In particular, it fell for consecutive trading days until this month, showing a decline rate, and Shinhan Savings Bank exercised its collateral rights to sell shares against it. Counter-selling refers to disposing of stocks if additional collateral is not provided in the event that the value of collateral falls due to a sharp drop in stock prices.Stock industry sources are questioning whether StemScience shares put up by Shinhan Savings Bank for sale in the market are the largest shareholders. According to a quarterly report by StemScience, the largest shareholder, Yoon Kang-joon, the head of Gangnam Bedro Hospital, owns a large shareholder, and former chairman of NK Bio, Kim Young-joo.In response, StemScience said, ""There has been no change in Yoon Hyung-ki's shares, and former chairman Kim Young-joo is still unable to sell the shares because the shares are tied to a protected Jesus,"" adding, ""We asked Shinhan Savings Bank whose shares and how many."" In fact, StemScience's largest shareholder has never announced that it has received a stock mortgage.An official at Shinhan Savings Bank dismissed the fact that he knew nothing about the actual owner of the stock, saying, ""We did not repay the loan until the maturity of the stock collateral loan expired.""Stock industry sources estimate that unless StemScience's largest shareholder's stake was sold in reverse, a certain person gathered several shares to take out a loan. According to the current regulations, shareholders who hold stocks or more of listed companies are obligated to report the status of mass holdings.Currently, StemScience is likely to have held shares in the name of several people who are reluctant to reveal their existence because there are no shareholders other than Yoon and former chairman Kim.An official from the securities industry said, ""It is not easy to understand that the current status of shareholders is understood in the process of closing the list of shareholders to hold a general shareholders' meeting.""Europe's bad news broke the KOSPI STEM SCIENCE European Stock Exchange Weekly Standard The biggest fall since last month You can't be an exception You have your own hideout at a top-notch company Why you do your homework all night Rather than homework Real-time news Money Today No unauthorized reprinting and redistribution"

"Possibility of managing items such as i-net school...As the deficit settlement period for the consecutive year of the DIA scandal CNK approaches, listed companies that are feared to designate management items should take care of audit reports more carefully.The Financial Services Commission and the Korea Exchange announced a plan to advance the listing withdrawal system last year, and listed companies that have recorded operating losses for consecutive years since the fiscal year will be designated as management stocks. Therefore, if a company that has been in the red for a year recorded a deficit last year, it will be designated as a management item.According to the disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, the total number of listed companies that have recorded operating losses for consecutive years from the middle age of the monthly settlement corporation is the total number of listed companies. Among them, companies that have already been designated as management items are total companies, and new growth engine companies that are exceptions to designation of management items are new companies. In other words, there is a possibility that the remaining changes will be designated as a management item.The iNet School, which saw its stock price rise the most this year with the upper limit for as many trading days this year, is in danger of designating a management item. iNet School, one of the most popular ""don't ask"" stocks, has soared again due to its entry into Apple's education business. But performance overshadows this relentless rise in stock prices. Not only did it record operating losses for consecutive years, but it also posted losses in both quarters last year. It is recording cumulative operating loss of KRW 100 million until the quarter.Electric vehicle stocks are likely to be designated as a management item at a time when G&D Wintec has already been decided to delist and is on the verge of being expelled. Motors has a cumulative operating deficit of KRW 100 million in the quarter of last year.Among the companies that have recorded losses for consecutive years, C&K, which recently caused a diamond scandal, stands out. On the previous day, the Securities and Futures Commission filed a complaint with the prosecution against the CEO and others on charges of taking hundreds of millions of won in unfair profits by setting up a local subsidiary in Cameroon and falsely recording diamond deposits in a diamond mine and manipulating stock prices. C&K Inter made operating losses of 100 million won to 100 million won to 100 million won to 100 million won. However, cumulative operating profit for the quarter has reached 100 million won this year. Although resource developers such as TerrariSource Korea Resources Investment Development Co., Ltd., P.A., and UI Energy Co., along with C&K Inter, have been in the red for the past year, except for UI Energy, it is expected to overcome the crisis of designation of management stocks.In addition, NK Bio and Dongyang Telecom are expected to shift to surplus last year to address concerns over designation of management items. NKBio expects to have achieved more than 100 million won in sales last year compared to the previous year. In addition, it is highly likely that it will make operating profit by completing technology transfer to Medinet Japan and Zielaparo Korea, which will increase sales of immune cell treatments. An official from NK Bio said, ""The final audit results should be released next month, but considering the current situation, we expect to end the annual deficit march.""Dongyang Telecom said it recorded sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won as a result of its preliminary results last year. The company explained that although it recorded a deficit for consecutive years, it has resolved the risk of incorporating management stocks due to the turnaround in operating profit last year.

The One & C is a company that specializes in exhibition design business. In Korea, it is ranked first in the industry after construction technology.The exhibition business specialized company is actually a concept of an implementer. It receives orders from public institutions and distributes business rights in each sector to small and medium-sized professional manufacturing and design companies.

The company decided to share half of the sales generated by The One&C's exhibition project.CEO Choi said, ""We decided to cooperate with The One&C to generate stable profits,"" adding, ""Considering the high reputation and planning power in the exhibition business industry, orders are expected to continue to occur, and L&C's performance will improve significantly.""The One & C recorded sales of 100 million won in the first half.

"Blue Gem D&C, a KOSDAQ-listed manufacturer of artificial leather, was suspended from trading stocks in the past to receive money from some small creditors only by applying to the court. This is because Kim, who has a bond of KRW 100 million, filed for bankruptcy with the Seoul Central District Court. When the bankruptcy application became known, the Korea Exchange suspended the sale of stocks. Daily trading resumed a day after Kim dropped his bankruptcy application, but stock prices plunged to the lower limit.Bankruptcy applications against listed companies are being abused. This is because small creditors are making excessive bankruptcy applications by taking advantage of the suspension of stock trading when they file for bankruptcy to get money.According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, listed companies that have been filed for bankruptcy by creditors this year have changed their names, including Blue Gem D&C. This is a significant increase from last year's rewriting. L&CPI, a KOSDAQ-listed company, was filed for bankruptcy twice last month and this month by the same creditor. As a result, trading was suspended for one day last month and one day this month.Under the current Debtor Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act, anyone can file for bankruptcy regardless of the amount as long as they can only confirm that they have bonds. When filing a bankruptcy application, the exchange immediately suspends trading and designates it as a management item. If this happens, investors suspect that they are really going bankrupt. Even if the bankruptcy application is withdrawn and the transaction resumes, the stock price is on a downward trend. Shares of L&CP have fallen since Monday when it was first filed for bankruptcy. Shares of KB C&T, a securities market-listed company that announced its bankruptcy application last month, also fell from won to won on the same day.A company official said, ""As stock trading is suspended just by filing for bankruptcy, the company has no choice but to repay the debts of creditors who filed for bankruptcy first.""Vice President Nam Kang-wook said, ""It is a problem for small creditors to file for bankruptcy,"" adding, ""Only for bankruptcy claims filed by creditors with a certain amount of bonds, such as abnormal equity capital, the exchange needs to stop trading.""Reporter Ahn Jae-kwang.

"IU Energy, which was on the verge of delisting due to rumors of accounting fraud and rejection of audit opinions, will be able to take a breather.According to the Japanese financial industry, the KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange has decided to give a period of improvement until Monday as a result of deliberation by the listing committee on U-I Energy.In an audit report submitted on last month, UI Energy was rejected due to uncertainty over its scope of audit and viability as a continuing company, resulting in reasons for delisting. However, U.I. Energy filed a complaint and the KOSDAQ market headquarters decided last month to continue the listing committee.According to UI Energy, Samil Accounting Corp., which was in charge of auditing, conducted due diligence in Iraq through overseas partners, which affected the granting of an improvement period. Samil Accounting Corp. is also in charge of re-audit of U-I Energy until Monday.The key to the audit is expected to be the collection of Iraqi accounts receivable. Earlier, Samil Accounting Corp. pointed out that the survival of the continuing company depends on the possibility of recovering related assets and the existence of construction debts at Dohook Hospital.IU Energy has forged and announced its corporate bank account as if it had collected $10,000 in monthly sales bonds last year, and the Financial Services Commission's Securities and Futures Commission recently filed a complaint with the prosecution against CEO Choi Kyu-sun.As the issue of uncertainty over the collection of bonds arose, U-I Energy submitted an official letter to the Financial Services Commission on the collection schedule sent by the Iraqi Kurdistan Autonomous Government through the Korean Embassy there. Currently, U-I Energy has announced that it will collect its sales bonds by Monday through several correctional disclosures.A UI Energy official said, ""The partner of Samil Accounting Corp. reviewed the possibility of recovering the sales bonds through due diligence in Iraq,"" adding, ""We will sincerely collect the bonds by the deadline for monitoring.""Once you have a chance to revive, you are not completely out of the woods yet. The details of implementation of the improvement plan must be submitted within days after the end of the improvement period. The KOSDAQ market headquarters will hold a listing committee within days from the date of receipt of the application and decide whether to delist.At this time, if a limited or appropriate opinion is expressed as a result of the re-audit of Samil Accounting Corporation, UI Energy will have an opportunity to revive. However, if the re-audit opinion is rejected again, the delisting process will be carried out.How far are the poor voting for the rich?

"Minority shareholders who rebelled against UI Energy are raising their voices of opposition by collecting voting rights and demanding a change in auditors. Small shareholders say they cannot trust the information provided by the company, such as the continuous change in supply-related disclosures.According to the Japanese securities industry, minority shareholders of UI Energy plan to present an audit change agenda at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to be held on the upcoming day. The plan calls for the dismissal of Shin Jae-joong, CEO of Paramount Consulting, from the audit and appointment of Kim Tae-ho, CEO, and Park, head of Top Fisheries, as auditors.The minority shareholders' meeting is currently collecting voting rights by securing a stake in Manchuria. Shareholder proposals can be proposed if they hold more than their shares.An official from the minority shareholders' meeting said, ""We cannot trust the company's disclosure and information, such as continuing to change the disclosure related to supply,"" adding, ""We demanded a change of auditors to get more transparent information on the company.""UI Energy was abruptly suspended from trading last year due to rumors of accounting fraud. Initially, it was announced that $10,000 was deposited on a monthly basis, some of the sales bonds for mobile generators in Iraq's Kurdish region. However, he received a penalty for unfaithful disclosure by correcting that there was no actual deposit in the month, and was suspended from trading due to rumors of fraudulent accounting. The deal has been suspended for months now.In particular, UI Energy has recorded operating losses for consecutive years since last year. Since it recorded a cumulative loss of KRW 100 million until the quarter of last year, if it records a deficit for consecutive years, it can be designated as a management item according to KOSDAQ market regulations. Therefore, payment is expected to play a decisive role in incorporating management items.Minority shareholders said, ""The company has been postponing the schedule since late last year due to the change of government in Iraq's Kurdish government, but there seems to be something wrong with the collection of accounts receivable.""An official of UI Energy said, ""We will know the problem of accounting fraud only when the total amount of unpaid construction costs related to the project is deposited within this month,"" adding, ""We expect the payment to be made by this month.""However, it is unlikely that the actual auditor will be changed. Small shareholders are currently securing stakes in Manchuria, but securing voting rights is not going as smoothly as expected, with the failure to secure a list of shareholders.According to the stock distribution status as of the end of last year, the number of shares owned by affiliate UI&C is Manchuria, and Chairman Choi Kyu-sun is securing Manchuria. On top of that, Jeffrey Jones' stake, which is considered a friendly stock on the company's side, is also known as Manchuria.An official from a minority shareholder explained, ""Although it is difficult to secure voting rights because the company does not disclose the list of shareholders, we plan to increase the friendly stake as much as possible before the extraordinary shareholders' meeting.""Kim Sang-yoon's Virgo auction fraud has intensified the dispute over the investigation into the accident between the U.S. and the U.S. and Asiana Airlines, and Samsung Electronics wants to work the most.Unexpectedly, the upper part is the intermittent fasting method.This means that public healthcare special committee witnesses are absent Hong Joon Pyo branch office report anytime, anywhere in your life Smart Economic Daily Real-time News and Breaking News app | Korea's best financial information terminal eDaily Market Point for mobile stock trading experts"

"Contrary to the fact that the economic controversy is different, U.I.

Currently, U-I Energy has invested its stake in the Bazian mine in Iraq in the form of a consortium with the Korea National Oil Corporation.Lee Hak-jae, a member of the National Assembly's Knowledge Economy Committee, said, ""According to the data submitted by the Korea National Oil Corporation, the exploration of the oil field development project involving the Korea National Oil Corporation confirmed that there is no crude oil or economic feasibility."" In particular, he claimed that the daily production of the Bajian Mine, which was invested by U-I Energy, was also about barrel. I talked about this with an official of UI Energy. The Kurdish oil fields are not economical. It's not what we think. It is not known on what grounds such an allegation was made. That is not true. According to the data, the drilling has been completed and it is already economical. However, in the case of Bajan Mine, tea drilling has been completed and tea drilling is currently being prepared. How much daily production was predicted at the time of the tea drilling? The daily output was about a barrel. But it was reduced to a barrel. In addition, mining does not end with a single drilling, but continues to drill. The tea plant is still being prepared. What are the future measures?

"This article was released on Monday in Capital Markets Media Money Today.Kingdom Holdings, a subsidiary of U-I Energy, will soon sign a memorandum of understanding as it completes financing for the acquisition of Woori Tobacco.According to the Japanese industry, Kingdom Holdings is expected to pay a performance deposit to the sale of Woori Cigarette and sign a memorandum of understanding for the acquisition. Afterwards, it is expected that the contract will be signed at the latest through due diligence.The acquisition price of our cigarettes is known to be in the mid-billion-won range. It is lower than the 100 million won liquidation value of our cigarettes last year. Considering that the price offered by Kingdom Holdings at the time of the sale of the car was 100 million won, the sale value fell to half.The acquisition fund is almost in the final stage. Kingdom Holdings is an acquisition target company invested by a consortium of U.I. Energy and a Middle East tobacco import company. The company has been looking for additional investors to further strengthen its acquisition funds as the acquisition failed to raise funds in the car sale.Recently, Kingdom Holdings completed raising a mid-billion won acquisition fund, which is expected to succeed in attracting domestic financial investors. Analysts say that the deal is unlikely to be canceled as it was when the car was sold, as investors' burden of acquisition funds has also been decided.If U-I Energy succeeds in acquiring Korean cigarettes, it will be more competitive in the Middle East market. Recently, U-Ai Energy signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia's Prince Nawaf bin Mohammed on investment in issuing convertible bonds and business cooperation in energy sports. It is analyzed as a strategy to see synergy through various areas of business in the Middle East.The market expects the deal to proceed without any major problems until the main contract as financing has been confirmed. In the end, creditors' consent is expected to be the key to the deal's success at the last remaining rally.Woori Tobacco's secured creditors are composed of Woori Bank, Korea Exchange Bank, Mirae Mutual Savings Bank, and Kyongnam Bank.

"As unfair trade by C&K Inter using news of the development of the Cameroon diamond mine has been revealed, attention is naturally being paid to the direction of other resource developers. In particular, there are two listed companies on the KOSDAQ market that have continued to be resource developers despite the expulsion of individual resource developers in a row last year and year.The main characters are U-Ai Energy and Terrarisos, which are carrying out oil development projects in Iraq and the Bashkortostan Republic, which are autonomous republics in Russia, respectively. Both companies have already experienced a surge in stock prices along with rising oil prices in years ago, they are also listed companies for resource development.However, the recent situation in both new companies is not good. In particular, UI Energy is still conducting its own investigation after its transaction was abruptly suspended due to rumors of accounting fraud last year. Both companies are suffering from poor performance. All of the new companies recorded operating losses for the year in a row, and in the case of IU Energy, it recorded accumulated losses of KRW 100 million until the quarter of last year. If the deficit is recorded for consecutive years until this year, it will be designated as a management item according to KOSDAQ market regulations.In addition, both IU Energy and TerrariSource have been actively using the media by releasing favorable press releases. In the case of IU Energy, it announced a stake acquisition contract with Gennell Energy, which has not been paid, and in last month, it drew attention by saying that it is in negotiations to sell the stake for billions of dollars even before the contract is completed. However, as UI Energy's plan to pay for the stake acquisition through a general public offering of more than 100 million won went to waste, the contract for the stake acquisition between UI Energy and Genel Energy has yet to be completed.Terarisos is also negotiating with China's state-run oil company Sinopec for the first time in last month after signing a memorandum of understanding on the sale of its stake in Vinkasa. Last month, the media reported that Sinopec had been promised billions of dollars in investment for the year, but there has been no disclosure yet. Rather, after spraying a favorable press release late last year, the largest shareholder was found to have sold a large number of shares, drawing unfavorable attention.After the KOSDAQ market was created, companies that challenged resource development steadily emerged, but there has never been a successful case of resource development. In an interview with the media in the past, Yoo Han-seo, CEO of Terrarisos, stressed this fact and said that he would become the first KOSDAQ-listed company to succeed in resource development. This is why attention should be paid to the results of the investigation into the accounting fraud theory of UI Energy and the results of the negotiations on the sale of Terarisos' shares in Synopec.

"Lee Ki-tae, a former vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, was transfused as a close friend of Lee Ki-tae, a former vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, who is considered the main player in the all-in-an-call myth in the acquisition of Daewoo Electronics, but it became a difficult situation. This is because companies that invested have been delisted or are expected to be delisted. He also jumped into the race to acquire Daewoo Electronics, drawing keen attention to the results.Recently, the KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange announced that Nspert's delisting was confirmed to be coming. NSPERT is a subsidiary of Insprit, the same KOSDAQ-listed company, and it has been attracting attention for its unusual effect as former Vice Chairman Lee is known to have invested in Insprit.However, the company received inappropriate audit opinions last month and its financial risks increased as its capital was completely eroded. Sales in the last quarter also increased by only 100 million won and operating losses reached 100 million won.Insprit, which is directly related to former Vice Chairman Lee, is also on the verge of delisting due to sparks caused by Nspert. Inspreet recorded a net loss of 100 million won last year and its financial structure is very weak, with its debt ratio reaching . as of the end of the month. Earlier this year, external auditors expressed negative opinions, causing the delisting, but the company submitted a liquidity preparation plan last month, taking a step back from the crisis. Trading in sovereignty has been suspended until an audit opinion on the half-year report is released this year-round.At the request of Lee Chang-seok, former vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, Lee injected 100 million won into Inspreit last month. In response, the Korea Exchange said it would delay its withdrawal until it confirms its audit opinion on financial statements in the first half of this year, which was evaluated as meaningful only for emergency measures to prevent it from leaving. At that time, former Vice Chairman Lee participated in the management of the company in the form of a management advisor.Insprit was not the only investment failure due to personal acquaintance. Last year, Wal-Freetech conducted a paid-in capital increase in which former vice chairman Lee allocated hundreds of millions of won worth of stocks to raise funds for the company's operation. As a result, former Vice Chairman Lee secured more than a stake and became the company's largest shareholder. At that time, it was reported that the investment opportunity was also decided to make a financial investment when an acquaintance had difficulty managing the company.Pre-tech soared to the highest level of the year due to the Lee Gi-tae effect at the time, but has fallen more than now. At that time, the acquisition price was KRW per share, but as of today, the stock price is being traded at the original price, it is losing some money in the valuation difference.Former Vice Chairman Lee, however, explained that all of them were investments without problems.Recently, Lee has emerged as a key figure in the acquisition of Daewoo Electronics. In addition to Dongbu Group, which announced that it submitted a bid acquisition letter on the last day, competition for the acquisition is expected to be fierce between Kader Investment Samlamiders Group, a Swedish home appliance company, Electrolux, and Bosch, a German electronic parts company. It is not known whether the purpose of the acquisition of former Vice Chairman Lee is to directly participate in management or to simply invest.An industry source said, ""Unlike the case of Freetec and Inspreet, this time, it is believed that the intention to return to the electronics industry and participate in management in earnest, not some investment."" After leaving Samsung Electronics last year, Lee moved to the head of Yonsei University's Future Convergence Technology Research Institute and resigned last month, and is reportedly focusing on the acquisition.Lee Moon-se, who built hundreds of millions of old houses on the Chosun Biz Hot News, also showed interest in iPad JobsIf the military doesn't pay for rice cake, the U.S. will find out, and a new trend has begunSales of light cars and the biggest growth in history are the recession."
"Insprit, which is on the verge of delisting due to worsening financial stability in Shinpyeong, has seen its credit rating fall by three steps due to its recent sharp deterioration in financial stability.The credit rating agency said it will lower the corporate credit rating of Insprit from one to another through occasional evaluations. The previous downward review grade monitoring target was also maintained.Insprit posted a net loss of KRW 100 million last year and its financial structure is very weak, with its debt ratio reaching . as of the end of the month.Earlier this year, the reason for delisting occurred due to the improper expression of opinions by external auditors, but it has taken a step back from the crisis based on the liquidity preparation plan last month.Credit rating explained that the current decline in operating performance has significantly reduced the responsiveness to short-term loan repayment and early repayment of convertible bonds held, adding that there is still a possibility of delisting depending on the submission of semi-annual reports and the auditor's opinion.Im Sung-kyu See eDaily newspaper anytime, anywhere in your life Smart Economic Daily News Real-time news and financial markets in stock trading EDaily Market point for mobile service experts in Korea.

"The Snow Theme of Android Typhoon Daejangju. A leader in the era of MacConvergence, whose goal was to buy it full. The goal is the title of a past securities firm report on Inspreet, which is on the verge of delisting recently.Insprit, whose annual infrastructure valley has been listed indirectly as an intro-mobile. Securities firms' corporate reports on the company have so far been total. Starting with Solomon Securities in January, Prudential Torus Securities presented a corporate analysis report without investment opinions.Annual Insprit's stock price started at the won, but it soared from the end of the year to the won a year later, at the beginning of the month. Securities firms have been receiving positive reviews in earnest since the second half of the year.Hanmaek Investment & Securities Co. released a page-based corporate analysis report titled ""Screen Solvers with Unrivaled Technology Advantage"" last year, offering its first purchase investment opinion and target stock price. Mirae Asset Securities also said it is a leader in the convergence era and suggested the target stock price of investment opinions and won. Woori Investment & Securities also released a page-based report, calling it a leader in mobile solutions.At the end of the year, Android smartphone themes swept the market, and Inspirit soared from around the year's monthly won to the month's. Mirae Asset Securities' target stock price is over.However, with the month at its peak, Inspirit has gone downhill all year round. In the month of the adjustment, Hanmaek Investment & Securities offered 10,000 won for its investment opinion, saying that Insprit is the eye of an Android typhoon. It was said that additional stock prices are expected to rise in the long run, given that the technical level of INSPRITE is very high and that it is an early phase in which it is starting to form a collaborative relationship with Samsung Electronics. This was the last report of the Inspirit.a few years later at the end of the month Insprit is a management item and is in danger of delisting with its subsidiary Nspert. The stock price is suspended in won. Kider Power, which is the largest shareholder of Samsung Electronics, Lee Ki-tae, attracted attention as it increased its capital increase by KRW 100 million, but the reason for delisting occurred last month due to improper audit opinions. CEO Lee Chang-seok, the largest shareholder who was trying to sell, tried to recover the funds by selling his stake over-the-counter. CEO Lee is under investigation for suspicion of eating and running by selling stocks first and recovering funds in the crisis before the suspension of trading.Of course, business conditions change rapidly in the market and business and stock prices change rapidly. However, the fact that securities firm research's most devoted performance estimate is so far off is bitter. In particular, only blueprints were presented for the growth of subsidiary Inbricks.Hanmaek Investment & Securities estimates that Insprit will earn a net profit of 100 million won in annual sales and operating profit of 100 million won. However, operating profit of KRW 100 million, which is the level of actual sales, was only KRW 100 million, and net profit was KRW 100 million loss.Mirae Asset Securities also estimated that Insprit's annual sales and operating profit increased by . .00 million won, respectively, year-on-year. This is because the convergence solution market is rapidly expanding due to structural changes in the mobile communication market. However, the annual sales of Insprit remained at 100 million won and operating profit remained at 100 million won.In short, securities firms have presented blueprints for Insprit since the second half of the year, and stock prices have soared in the short term. However, the company has taken a completely different path from the brokerage house's outlook, and the brokerage houses haven't spoken a word since.The securities firm report has a big impact on the surge in stock prices.

Insprit said in a public announcement before the start of the market that the contract for the transfer of stock management rights of the largest shareholder has been terminated. Inspreet explained that the contract was terminated because the transferee Lee Kyo-seop did not pay the deposit of KRW 100 million that was supposed to be paid on the day of the contract.Insprit shares plunged back to their lows as if they had waited since the start of the market. For this reason, some in the market questioned whether CEO Lee failed to sell the company, which had deteriorated performance, through his student.In response, Inspirit dismissed market concerns that the company will focus on stabilizing its management again as it has been making steady sales of 100 million won every year in the network solution sector and CEO Lee has been operating for years. He said that both CEO and executives and employees are sorry for the fact that the cancellation of the contract adversely affected not only CEO Lee's individual but also the stock price.CEO Lee Chang-seok said, ""It was a plan to minimize the company's impact by recording massive losses last year, but it failed,"" adding, ""Now, NSPERT is seeking to secure additional capital, including conversion of investment, after this year's capital increase.""

"Most of them said they decided on a paid-in capital increase worth 100 million won through disclosure after the end of the market. It was the first public announcement since its listing. However, not many investors knew that Terraum was a successor to Neowave, which has been in the red in recent years.According to the industry, caution is required as many marginal companies are raising funds such as capital increase or bond issuance just after changing the name of the company. In the case of Terraum, the company changed its name last month and was listed on the list. Terraum's sales, which stood at 100 million won a year, fell noticeably to 100 million won last year, and its operating profit still continued to remain in the red, although the size of the deficit decreased to 100 million won.JH COS, which changed its name to D-Technology last month, decided to issue a paid-in capital increase worth KRW 100 million and bonds with the right to buy new shares on the day of its name change. The company also changed its name in the stock market. Last year, D-Technology's sales were KRW 100 million last year, halved from KRW 100 million a year, and its operating profit shifted from a surplus of KRW 100 million to a deficit of KRW 100 million won.International E&C decided to issue 100 million won two days after changing its name to International DY on last month. The business has been listed on the list. Although both sales and operating profit increased last year, international D.Y. saw its sales rise to 100 million won, compared to the previous year. It only increased and operating profit remained in the red. International D.Y. abandoned its original mission, Glonex, and changed its name to Daewoo Solar last month, and changed its name to International E&C after a month.Although it has not yet been listed as a change, Geomento, which changed its name to Trace last month, has decided to increase its paid-in capital for general public offerings worth 100 million won. Trace saw its sales fall to 100 million won last year and operating losses fall to 100 million won, more than doubling its deficit from the previous year's 100 million won. Giomento has a history of changing its name from Tinyatech to Windsky again in the year to Giomento.Chung Yoon-mo, a researcher at the Korea Capital Markets Institute, said, ""If marginal companies change their names and raise funds to pack up their companies, innocent victims are likely to suffer,"" and advised investors to carefully examine financial statements and various disclosures.Reporter Lee Junhee...Korea's top female college students are exposed to new technology, faster undersea express trains, and surprise sales drugs, and even female students will be sexually harassed, shocked, and punished by the Galaxy shaman"
"If there are frequent changes to the largest shareholder or CEO, it should be questioned whether there is a way to prevent investors' so-called fears of delisting, which are repeated every year. Frequent management changes lead to increased stock price volatility and lead to legal battles over the change of the largest shareholder. Of course, there are changes in the largest shareholders that help improve the corporate financial structure, such as accompanying capital increase, but frequent changes are often investments aimed at capital gains. SVH, which was recently delisted, changed its CEO several times last year, and Olive Nine recorded the largest shareholder change of the CEO change. Looking at delisting companies, many companies have changed their CEO or major shareholder more than once in recent years.Second, companies with signs of insolvency tend to frequently disclose funding disclosures. Many of these companies cite poor financial structure improvements, such as lack of operating funds, as the reason for financing. If this is not improved and delisted, investors will bear the investment losses intact. Despite the steady surplus, companies that continue to raise funds through corporate bond issuance and capital increase are also dangerous. Excessive financing means that the company's cash flow situation is not good, so it is highly likely that the surplus will also go bankrupt. In the case of SVH mentioned earlier, it was delisted after conducting a paid-in capital increase. In the past, KMS Phantom Entertainment, CNC Enterprise, Cheongram Digital Zidikov, etc. were also expelled from the stock market after surviving with capital increase amid continuous deficits.Third, companies that continue to add businesses that are not related to their own businesses should also be careful. There may be a purpose of diversifying businesses for continued growth, but some companies add business purposes by jumping on the theme to boost stock prices without specific plans. These companies are generally likely to have problems with their existing businesses. Construction companies are adding businesses that are far from their main businesses, such as software businesses, pharmaceutical companies, travel brokerage and information and communication businesses, and semiconductor manufacturers, golf practice range businesses.The fourth issue to be suspected is frequent change of mission. This year, many companies have changed their missions. Although these companies say they change their names to enhance their corporate image, many of them actually use it as a means to dilute their corporate image, which has deteriorated due to poor performance or frequent disciplinary action. Looking at these companies, there are many insolvent companies. D-Technology Trace PSMC C&K International recorded a deficit and recently changed its name.Finally, there are companies that try to exaggerate their performance. Every year, about one out of all listed companies announces their expected performance. Many of these companies are close to or exceeding their expected performance, but many of them announce excessively high their expected performance compared to the previous year due to their entry into overseas markets. Most companies that announce rosy forecasts without accurate market forecasts and plans often see their actual sales far below forecasts or turn into deficits.In particular, the expected performance achievement of companies belonging to the KOSDAQ market is significantly lower than that of the securities market. The drugs of companies that announce expected performance are less than this average. Last year, SVH had a rosy outlook that it would achieve sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won, but it was eventually delisted.In addition, what should be carefully examined is whether the obligations to investors are well maintained. Only among domestic listed companies are openly communicating with investors through . Many of these companies remain silent after using investors on a one-time basis for short-term purposes such as raising stock price stimulus funds. When a company that usually has little activity suddenly proceeds, it is necessary to carefully examine its intention or background. a sign of insolvency Frequent changes in management rights of the largest shareholder or CEO soon lead to increased volatility in stock prices and can lead to legal disputes over changes in the largest shareholder. Frequent financing Many of the companies that raise funds without clear reasons have poor financial structures, such as lack of operating funds. Frequent addition and change of business purpose These companies are generally likely to have problems with their existing businesses. Many frequent name changes are used as a means to dilute the corporate image tarnished by poor performance or frequent disciplinary action. Most companies that have announced excessive performance puffed roses often see their actual sales far below forecasts or turn into deficits.Do studies on mobile."

The monthly operating cost is expected to cost about 10,000 won.Top R&D President Kim Kyu-ha said, ""Since we approached the concept of customized high-quality electronics rather than electric vehicles, it would be more appropriate to see them as luxury home appliances that government plans to start mass-producing and selling them in the second half of next year.G&D Wintec, which was selected as the organizer of the development of electric vehicle inverters by the Honam Economic Zone's leading industrial support group last month, signed an agreement with Gwangju Metropolitan City last month to build a cluster of electric vehicles.If G&D Wintech moves to Gwangju, Gwangju's electric vehicle cluster construction project, which aims to localize key parts of electric vehicles and demonstrate test production, is expected to gain momentum.Gwangju City will provide various tax benefits such as acquisition tax, registration tax, and property tax exemption in time for G&D Wintech's relocation to Gwangju, and will first purchase the company's electric car as an official vehicle.Reporter Kim Han-sik from Gwangju...MacBook Air challenges Samsung Electronics' smartphone market by passing safely when riding a plane caught by rhinitis and snoring at home.Korea's patent productivity is the highest in the world.

"Increasing distrust of KOSDAQ-listed companies As distrust of KOSDAQ-listed companies grows, major shareholders or minority shareholders are trying to prevent management dismissal or capital reduction through extraordinary shareholders' meetings.According to the electronic disclosure of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, shareholders of G&D Wintech decided to collect shareholder power of attorney from work to reject the large-scale reduction plan at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to be held on the upcoming day.What G&D Wintech shareholders are facing as a problem is the loan reduction plan approved at the G&D Wintech board of directors on last month. G&D Wintech is seeking to merge its shares into one state to improve its financial structure and increase capital efficiency at the time. However, shareholders oppose the plan, saying the company is trying to pass a reduction bill that only causes shareholder losses without efforts to normalize its management.A small shareholder official said, ""There is a possibility that it could be discussed during an extraordinary shareholders' meeting, but the goal is to reject the loan reduction plan,"" adding, ""We plan to collect shareholder power through mail from the coming day when the delegation is available.""Terraum is a case in which a large shareholder has offered to dismiss an auditor and appoint an internal and external director.

"Following this, G&D Wintech has been designated as a management item, and electric vehicle-related stocks have been suffering this year.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, G&D Wintec was designated as a management item because the capital erosion rate exceeded the half-year report submitted the previous day. Sales reached 100 million won in the first half, but operating profit recorded a deficit of 100 million won, and net profit recorded a large loss of 100 million won. In particular, the government has decided to reduce the number of shares this month, but additional losses due to the designation of management items are expected to be inevitable.The decline of electric vehicle-related stocks continues this year. Last month, the company, designated as a management item, sold a building worth hundreds of millions of won to secure liquidity and carried out major reductions to escape the crisis of capital erosion. However, it is still designated as a managed item, and the stock price has fallen more than at the beginning of the year.Accuris, whose stock price exceeded 10,000 won last year as an electric vehicle-themed stock, is currently designated as a ventilation item for investors. The current stock price is won.

Individuals who made net purchases in the beginning of the market turned around in the second half of the market and sold a net 100 million won. Foreigners continued their net selling for the first day, seeing the fate of 100 million won.Top market cap stocks were higher.

"Correct the articles sent at 1:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. as follows. In the case of G&D Wintech, the article was published due to the designation of management items, not the designation of the delisting substance, but the designation of the delisting substance. Eugene data, which was rejected, was also incorrectly marked as subject to delisting, even though it was the addition of the reason for the management item, not the reason for delisting. I corrected the article that was already out. I apologize to the company and readers and I will try to write an accurate article.On the expiration date of submission of the first-half report, there were a series of restrictions on audit opinions or refusal of opinions on KOSDAQ-listed companies.Eugene Data was rejected as the highest warning in the audit report, adding to the reason for designating a management item. In addition, Pyeongsan and ESC Life, a big match, were limited in their opinions.YU JIN's data is rejected.Daeguk Pyeongsan STC's opinion limited to Eugene Data was rejected by the accounting firm on the same day. This is because it is impossible to predict whether or not to win the ongoing KRW 100 million check claim lawsuit will have a significant impact on the financial statements.The company also said that the capital erosion rate reached .100 million won and the total capital was .100 million won.Denial of opinion is a higher level of warning than the limit. In the case of restrictions, there are important defects in the financial statements, but if they are sufficiently considered and corrected, it is the same as the appropriate opinion. However, rejection of an opinion is made if it is impossible to express an opinion or if the entity's continuity is objectively very unclear.In the case of refusal of the audit opinion, it is considered that the requirement for delisting occurs, and the transaction is immediately suspendedLarge countries that have been designated as management items due to capital erosion have been limited to audit opinions. Pyeongsan also failed to provide data for the review of asset damage on tangible assets and received limited audit opinions from accounting firms.STC Life was limited due to omission of commentary on uncertainties related to corporate households. As capital erosion has reached, it is inevitable that the reasons for the review of the substance of mutual loss will occur.The limitation of audit opinions does not immediately lead to reasons for delisting. However, restrictions often lead to rejection of opinions. However, if the reason for the limited occurrence is resolved by the deadline for submitting the next audit report, it may be avoided. A series of reports of abnormal capital erosion also reported a series of cases in which reasons for designating management items beyond capital erosion have occurred due to the expiration of the report.G&D Wintec announced that despite receiving the audit opinion, there was a reason for designating a management item beyond capital erosion. In the first half of this year, capital erosion reached .DBES Korea also announced that despite the appropriateness of the audit opinion, capital erosion in the first half of the year reached .On the other hand, cases of deviating from capital erosion have also been reported. Point Eye said that the capital erosion rate was . last year, which caused the designation of management items, but the reason was resolved by lowering it to . in the first half of this year.Reports for the first half of the year can be received until midnight on that day.A source at the exchange said, ""It is rare for a report to be submitted until the deadline is imminent, so we usually submit the report by the time limit. However, in the previous half of the year, the report was submitted beyond the evening time.""As of this time, pharmaceutical companies subject to KOSDAQ have submitted audit reports.Meanwhile, China's Goseom, which drew attention to the expiration date of the report, announced on the same day that it had received final approval from the Singapore stock market to extend the regular shareholders' meeting to this month.

"Attention is focusing on whether electric vehicle stocks, which suffered an extreme slump in the first half of last year, will revive as stock trading resumed after the decline of electric vehicle representative companies. Other electric vehicle stocks also responded with a rise as the stock market led for the first time in a long time, soaring from the previous trading day as trading resumed last day and then soaring to the upper limit for two days in a row. Trading had been suspended for potatoes since last month. In the stock market, other electric vehicle stocks such as Motors and G&D Wintech also showed a slight rise, showing that electric vehicle stocks are rising together for the first time in a long time.The situation of electric car owners in the first half of this year was a total mess. Last year, it recorded a large deficit of KRW 100 million, reaching the capital erosion rate, and as a result, it was designated as a management item last month. If the capital erosion rate is not lowered below within the first half of the year, it will be delisted, so the reduction was eventually decided. G&D Wintec also took the lead in potatoes after recording a loss of 100 million won last year.The impact of worsening management was reflected in stock prices. Shares fell in the first half of the year alone, the highest decline among KOSDAQ stocks. G&D Wintech shares also fell. In other words, Motors has done a good job, only falling.Electric vehicle owners are looking for a revival in the second half of the year. It is looking for rehabilitation measures from various angles, such as mergers and acquisitions of capital increase after capital reduction. The company is also actively attracting investment in the U.S. by opening its first dealer and showroom in the western part of the U.S. at the end of last month. Recently, it signed a contract with the Korea Pension Association to sell electric vehicles.Analysts say that the direction of electric vehicle stock prices depends on performance. An analyst at a securities firm said, ""The reason why electric car stocks have fallen like this is because they have no performance to support the stock price,"" adding, ""Even if other favorable factors related to electric vehicles occur, it will not be easy to recover stock prices without tangible results.""

"While low-speed electric vehicle companies are uniformly struggling in the stock market due to poor performance, stock prices are repeating a short-term jump. Stock prices sparkle on the news of favorable factors and then plunge as if when they did.G&D Wintec soared to its upper limit on news that it is planning to enter China's electric vehicle market on the last day. The fact that G&D Wintec signed a contract with China's Divo Group on the establishment of an investment joint venture drove the stock price. This includes Dibo Group paying KRW 100 million in patent usage fees and investing KRW 100 million separately through paid-in capital increase.However, G&D Wintec's rise was limited to the same day. The Japanese stock market turned downward as of the morning. It's trading down.G&D Wintec's stock price rose to the won level last year when the electric vehicle theme was in full swing, but now its stock price is rising and falling near the won below its face value.At one time, stock prices soared whenever news of a contract to establish a joint venture plant in the province, which fell into a management category after leading the electric vehicle craze. However, the contract between China and Hawaii to enter the U.S. market has remained at a mere level and failed, forcing investors who bought shares to bear losses, despite failing to secure investment in overseas businesses.

No unauthorized re-distribution."
"The KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange said it has designated KOAS&I as an unfaithful disclosure corporation because of its failure to comply with the disclosure. As a result, KOAS&I was fined 10,000 won for penalty points and disclosure violations.""I want to cry when I buy a house with a debt of Chosun Biz Hot News."" ""The first mango phone document editing in Korea is a monthly rent. I think I look familiar with the girl in the year-end settlement ""Aim for real estate"" Galaxy Tab commercial."
"Even in the KOSDAQ rally, there is a fierce exit wind.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, places such as KOAS & IC CD Technology are included in the delisting review list, waiting for the decision to delist from the real review committee.Moreover, all but CTL Tech, which was notified of the decision to delist on last month, and among the individual companies that have been undergoing a substantial review in recent months, the decision to delist has been made.As a result, there are voices of concern that the KOSDAQ market may fall into the grave of ants again.First of all, KOAS&I, which was decided to be subject to the delisting review on the last day, was included in the actual examination for violating regulations. The largest shareholder and CEO pushed for the sale of management rights at a time when it was designated as a ventilation item for investors last year.An official of the exchange said, ""We stipulate that investors who have changed their management rights should be delisted,"" adding, ""After reviewing the possibility of delisting with various comprehensive requirements, we decided to review the delisting.""SCD has also begun a substantial review of delisting due to accounting violations. The amount of embezzlement of the former CEO was falsely recorded as a short-term loan in the financial statements of the previous year and the quarter. As a result, SCD was fined KRW 100 million by the Securities and Futures Commission last month and was notified by the prosecution of the name of the CEO and former executives before the designation of external auditors.D-Technology has been undergoing substantive screening due to violations of financial statements and accounting for the first half of the year.In addition, most companies, including A1 Micro G&D Wintech and Shintec, have been notified of the delisting decision since last month, and investors are feared to leave the company. Among them, investment in green technology by L&Pinus has already been withdrawn from the stock market, and all A1Micro Cintech G&D Wintec have submitted an objection to delisting.A researcher at a securities firm said that individual investors are more likely to be exposed to risks because crimes such as embezzlement and stock trading using malpractice market manipulation usually occur in small and medium-sized companies.Kim Ki-duk's hot news: ""Where is the Internet speed the fastest? Old people don't have sex,"" revealed Ko Seung-deok, a lawmaker of the National Assembly, who appeared at the prosecution's office, and became transparent. No unauthorized re-distribution"
"Regarding the disclosure of the inquiry on the signing of the stock and management transfer contract, KOAS&I replied that the largest shareholder, Lee John Byung-joo, signed a stock management transfer contract with Noh Young-woo at the end of the month, but it was later invalidated due to differences of opinion.The Korea Exchange has suspended stock certificate transactions to protect investors and is reviewing whether they are subject to a substantial review of delisting. According to the regulations changed since last month, if the largest shareholder changes in a listed company designated as an investor's ventilation item, it will immediately suspend stock trading and determine whether it is subject to a substantial review of delisting.""We considered selling the management rights, but it was invalidated immediately,"" a stock manager at CoAS&I said. ""We will submit explanatory data to the exchange."" Currently, transactions are suspended and it is being determined whether they are subject to delisting review. Didn't they know that if the largest shareholder changes from the position of being selected as an investment ventilation item, they would go into the delisting review? There is a disagreement with the exchange here. From our point of view, we considered selling monthly management rights, but we thought there was no problem because it was invalidated immediately. Therefore, there was no response to this, but the exchange itself is taking issue with it. Currently, we are making explanatory materials to submit to the exchange. Other than that, it is difficult to answer. We've got a free capital increase for the month. The intention is to boost trading by increasing the number of stocks. At the end of the month, Lee Kyung-gu filed an injunction against listing new shares, but was dropped in about 15 days. There is nothing in particular to say other than the disclosure. At the end of the month, a reduction was made to improve the financial structure. In addition, at the end of the month, the paid-in capital increase of public offering worth KRW 100 million was also issued at the end of the month. As an existing investor, isn't it the same as the reduction in the holding share and the burden of quantity? There is nothing in particular to say other than the disclosure. According to the public announcement at the end of the month, Choi Won-seok, CEO of Shin Myung International Show, holds a stake. In addition, CEO Choi will file a lawsuit against the largest shareholder and CEO. Accordingly, the CEO Lee John Byung-joo will change to the representative system of Shin Ki-chang and Seo Ki-young. On Wall, it filed a lawsuit against Shinmyung International Show Day claiming ownership of Manju, and on Wall, CEO Choi dropped all lawsuits. What's the reason? I know the results, but I don't know the specific process such as collateral. There is nothing in particular to say other than the disclosure. Why did you transfer the core generator division of Ulsan plant to Central Ocean at the beginning of the month? It is difficult to say more than one part of the actual investment. At the end of the month, the video entertainment sector was added to the business purpose of the general shareholders' meeting, and the resource development and pharmaceutical sectors were added at the temporary shareholders' meeting in the middle of the month.

"KOAS&I managed to escape from the KOSDAQ market exit crisis.Japan's COS&I rose to the upper limit with the start of the market. The increase decreased to mid-day, but eventually compared to the previous day. The market finished in the right circle. The move came after the announcement made last month that there was no change in the largest shareholder.It is important whether or not the company's largest shareholder will be changed because KOAS&I is an item that evokes investors. Last month, the Korea Exchange designated the ventilation items of investors, and if the largest shareholder changes, it will be investigated whether it is subject to a substantial review of delisting. From the perspective of KOAS&I, it was driven to a situation where it could go through the delisting process.The story began when the exchange demanded an inquiry disclosure on last month after rumors circulated that the largest shareholder of KOAS&I had changed. In response, KOAS&I has more shares than the largest shareholder, Lee John Byung-joo, who is the largest shareholder of shareholder Choi Won-seok. I confirmed that it was a lot. Lee borrowed money from a company where Choi is the CEO with his stake as collateral, but the company arbitrarily handed over the stake to Choi.KOAS&I later filed a lawsuit against Choi's company for the return of the stock certificates and repaid the loans in full. An official from Korea S&I said, ""The issue related to the change of the largest shareholder has been completely resolved by receiving all of the collateral shares back.""Meanwhile, KOAS&I has changed its largest shareholder several times in recent years and its name has changed several times.

"KOAS&I soared to the upper limit on the news that its largest shareholder has not changed.As of 1 a.m., CoS&I is trading at 1 won higher than the previous day.On the last month, COS&I said that there was no change in the largest shareholder as it was confirmed that the ownership of the collateral stock was in the largest shareholder, Izone Byung-joo, in response to the request for an inquiry disclosure on the theory of change of largest shareholder.On last month, the Korea Exchange demanded the disclosure of the inquiry related to the rumor of the change of the largest shareholder. In response, KOAS&I replied through the disclosure of its stake that Choi Won-seok, a shareholder, confirmed as Manchuria, which has more shares than Manju, the largest shareholder, Lee John Byung-joo.KOAS&I explained that some of Choi Won-seok's shares were collateral stocks under Shinmyung International's monetary consumption loan contract, where Lee Jon-joo and Choi Won-seok serve as CEO, and that Shinmyung International transferred them from Choi Won-seok.The largest shareholder will not change as the largest shareholder, Izon Byung-joo, repaid the loan and received all of its collateral shares.

"KOAS&I is in danger of being subject to a substantial review of delisting.This is because if the largest shareholder fails to repay the funds borrowed with the stock as collateral, the secured stock may be transferred to another person and the largest shareholder may be changed. If the largest shareholder changes as it was designated as a ventilation item for investors last month, the Korea Exchange will determine whether it is subject to delisting review.According to the Japanese securities industry, Lee John Byung-joo, the largest shareholder of KOAS&I, borrowed funds from Shinmyung International last year with Manchuria as collateral.However, Shinmyung International handed over the shares as collateral to Shinmyung International CEO Choi Won-seok. As a result, CEO Choi's number of shares held by KOAS&I is higher than that of Lee.Currently, Lee's stock of CoS&I is Manju, and CEO Choi's stock is Manju, which is more than Manju.When CEO Choi announced last month that his holdings exceeded Lee, Lee responded that he would repay all loans and interest until the day to get back collateral stocks and file a lawsuit for the return of stock certificates if Choi did not return the shares. Lee, however, has yet to repay loans and interest.The company said, ""Lee informed CEO Choi that he had agreed to repay the loan and receive collateral stocks again on the last day,"" adding, ""We did not specify the timing of the loan repayment in the contract, but we expect it to be the end of the month.""He also said, ""We cannot say that the loans made with stocks as collateral were borrowed for Lee's personal use.""

"In response to the Korea Exchange's request for inquiry disclosure regarding the rumor of the change of the largest shareholder, KOAS&I replied that the number of shares of Choi Won-seok, the largest shareholder, was Manju, more than Manju.Some of Choi Won-seok's shares were collateral stocks under Shinmyung International's money consumption loan contract, and Shinmyung International arbitrarily transferred them from Choi Won-seok, but Lee John Byung-joo will repay loans and interest within months and return them through stock rights lawsuits.KOAS&I added that it will immediately disclose details on whether to transfer ownership of collateral stocks through monetary consumption loan contracts between Izon Byung-joo and Shinmyung International.Due to the disclosure of the inquiry response, the suspension of the stock trading transaction of KOAS&I will be lifted from Sunday morning.In response, the exchange said that if the largest shareholder changes are disclosed depending on whether the ownership of collateral stocks is transferred, the review may be conducted on whether it is subject to delisting under the KOSDAQ market listing regulations.

"Investors are suffering from the disclosure of sheepdogs by KOSDAQ-listed companies. Stock prices are also showing a sluggish trend in violation of significant disclosures that change supply contracts or hand over management rights.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Taechang Paros announced the acquisition of Comi shares late the previous day and was announced by the KOSDAQ market headquarters as an unfaithful disclosure corporation.Taechang Paros hurriedly made a public announcement only after the closing of the market the next day, not after the acquisition date of Comey's stake. The largest shareholder of Comey was Sako Partners, which had already signed a stake acquisition contract with Taechang Paros in Japan and received a down payment and an intermediate payment of 100 million won.As a result, stock prices, which had risen only once this month, plunged the previous day.An official of the Korea Exchange said, ""Considering the late decision to acquire Comey's stake, if the disclosure had been made at least by the next morning, it would not have been announced.""Donghwa Holdings was announced to be designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation on the last day due to the delay in the change of its subsidiary's CEO. Since then, stock prices have remained flat, but the average daily trading volume has plunged more than half of the usual level for the past three days and days since the announcement.Electronics was also announced to be designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to a change in the supply contract amount or more on the last day. The contract for supplying solar modules, which was signed with Dongwon Systems last month, has been reduced from 100 million won to 100 million won. As a result, stock prices have fallen slightly while the KOSDAQ index has risen more than during the period.In some cases, it may lead to delisting after becoming an unfaithful disclosure corporation. KOAS&I said that on last month, the largest shareholder and CEO signed a stock and management transfer contract with Noh Young-woo on last month, but it was invalidated immediately after the signing.However, in the end, it was designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to the delayed disclosure of the signing of the stock and management transfer contract that changed the largest shareholder, and at the same time led to a substantial examination of delisting.A researcher at a securities firm advised, ""In some cases, it is designated as a simple unfaithful disclosure corporation because it does not accurately understand the disclosure regulations, but if the company makes such belated disclosures several times, it can pose risks.""Meanwhile, in the KOSDAQ market this month, changes such as Polyvision Digital Ocean, Easy CoS&I, etc. were designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations.

"More than 10,000 spectators gathered to watch the final match of the Star League last month are displaying placards expressing regret.Saturday, last Monday. About an hour passed after the Kia Tigers won the Doosan Bears and all the spectators who visited Jamsil Baseball Stadium went home. About 10,000 people were gathered at the student gymnasium right next door. They gathered to watch the final of the Star League, a somewhat unfamiliar game competition for the general public. They couldn't leave even though the winner was already decided after the game. Someone was holding a placard saying, ""I was happy to have a star league,"" and someone covered their mouth and blushed. And the commentators who broadcast the game also shed tears in front of 10,000 visitors. This was because the Star League, a StarCraft Brewery game competition, ended at the end of the day.The name ""Star League"" will continue through the upcoming StarCraft Freedom Wing Game Competition, but those who attended the event could not hide their disappointment that they could not see the year-long Star Game Competition. What made more than 10,000 people feel sorry?Star League, a star game competition, is a representative icon of Korean sports. According to data released by the Korea Game Industry Promotion Agency last year, the size of the Korean professional sports market was 100 million won as of the year, and the ripple effect was more than trillion won. In the case of the professional game team at the time, the number of professional game teams was there, and in the case of the main league, Shinhan Bank sponsored a total of 100 million won per year from this year. This was close to the annual sponsorship cost of domestic professional sports such as volleyball and basketball, which was close to 100 million won. And the Star League has had a profound impact on the growth of these sports.At one time, the Star League Sports Industry Leading Star League is a representative competition in the Korean sports world where a total of official competitions were held every year, from the first tournament last year to the Tving Star League, which ended last year. It was the most popular sports competition in Korea, with the prize money of the main competition, which will be held for months, being broadcasted through cable broadcasting channel On-GameNet. On GameNet itself, a game broadcasting channel, was created through Star League, a star game competition.The history of sports is often believed to have originated in the world's first game league, which was born in North America. Depending on the time, the origin of the LAN party, which was planned at the same time but was popular in the United States at the time, is sometimes viewed as the origin. What is clear, however, is that these competitions were different from Korea's sports culture. There is a prize money at stake and there are players who participate in the competition, but there were no large number of visitors or broadcasters who flocked to watch the game. The player was a visitor and a broadcaster.In Korea, the concept of city hall was created due to the Hi-Tel GameNet League and the Professional Gamer Korea Open, which are the predecessors of the star league. This is why there have been a series of opening of competitive cable broadcasting such as game games in addition to On-Game Net. In particular, the second competition, the Pre-Chalbae On-Game Net Star League Final, was held at Yonsei University's Anniversary Hall, and more than hundreds of visitors gathered to watch the game. And just a year later, 10,000 spectators gathered at the Sky Star League held at Seoul Olympic Park. The figure exceeded 10,000 spectators at the professional baseball All-Star Game held at Sajik Baseball Stadium in Busan at the same time.In addition to the broadcasting system and viewing culture created by Star League, the influence on sports is fandom culture. Star players such as Terran's Emperor Lim Yo-hwan, Storm Jug, Hong Jin-ho, Heroes, Tos Park Jung-seok, Genius Lee Yoon-yeol, all rose to stardom through the Star League. This story had the effect of making even those who didn't know the game into fans. Among the representative players, Lim Yo-hwan was so popular that the number of members of the fan cafe once reached 10,000. As Telecom recruited Lim Yo-hwan to create a team, and Pantech & Curitel also founded the Currier Team with Lee Yoon-yeol at the forefront, the number of large companies' clubs increased. Since then, Hwaseung and Woongjin have participated and even established a team in the Air Force. At this point, the term ""professional gamer's salary of 100 million won"" also appeared.However, things have not been good recently for such a star league. The tournament, which was held in an ordinary year, only opened last month, about months after the Jin Air Star League final held last month. This is because a series of incidents in recent years have made it difficult to find sponsors. In particular, it faced a crisis due to star intellectual property rights issues and match fixing. The issue of star intellectual property rights has been one of the sports scandals that have been raised since last year. Unlike ordinary sports, sports are played using computer games, which are works. Ji Jae-kwon is a natural right of a legally guaranteed game maker. The problem was that star-based sports competitions were being held without the permission of the producer. Hanbit Soft, originally the star's domestic distributor, had tacitly allowed it. However, Blizzard, the original producer, raised a problem with the Korea Sports Association, which triggered the controversy over intellectual property rights. At that time, Blizzard was in a position not to sit idly by using its game commercially without permission. The Korea Sports Association protested against interfering with the league, which had been tacitly allowed for nearly years. The Korea Sports Association and Blizzard spent years without a clear agreement.And at a time when the release of Blizzard's new star is imminent, a big event takes place in the sports world. It is an incident in which the names of former and current players, including the best professional gamers at the time, manipulated the game in connection with Internet gambling sites. The incident will shake the popularity of star-based sports, which have been on the decline little by little.Starcraft package made by Blizzard.In addition to the popularity of the controversy over match-fixing intellectual property rights, Blizzard signed a contract to transfer sports intellectual property rights to Gratech for its games, including stars. This further complicated the intellectual property negotiations with the Korea Sports Association. In the end, the controversy grew as these issues were combined, and fans and society's views were not favorable. In particular, the atmosphere in the sports world has worsened since Wall Star was released in the same year. As the Korea Sports Association, the existing broadcasting company-oriented star competition, and the new star competition centered on Gratech and new clubs, the existing popular sports star competition also showed poor results. As a result, Shinhan Bank, which sponsored the professional league, stepped down from sponsorship after last year, and Telecom, the chairman of the Korea Sports Association, began sponsoring the professional league. In addition, On-Game Net's Star League also had difficulty finding sponsors, and cable broadcasters' games were closed. In addition, the dog game team was disbanded last year, temporarily creating a control team and commissioned by the Korea Sports Association.The decline in star-based sports eventually led to the Korea Sports Association and Blizzard joining hands, which were walking in parallel. Last month, the two sides agreed to cooperate in hosting the star-based competition through a visionary ceremony. The Korea Sports Association had concerns about the Star League, which has fallen in popularity to the point where it became difficult to find sponsors, and Blizzard also had a clear purpose to revitalize stars who were losing to popular games such as League of Legends in just over a year.In the end, the Star League, which has continued for years, will change its stock from star to star, and the professional league, which is underway at the same time as star and star, will be completely converted to star events at the end of the current season. Moreover, there is a new emerging League of Legends. League of Legends showed the possibility of the final of the Ajubu Champions League with more than a crowd. It feels similar to the year when the Star League was first held. For this reason, sports officials are half anticipated and half worried. There is hope that it will face a time of leap again and concern that it will be able to walk the path that the star league has taken again. Since the Star League, many games have tried sports shoes and have once been very popular. However, no other sport has been as popular as a star for a long time.However, there is hope in the industry. As Star did, it is expected that the broadcast of cable broadcaster On GameNet and the presence of star players will fully find the glory of the past. Attention is focusing on whether the newly launched star competition will regain the honor of attracting 10,000 spectators in Gwangalli, Busan, this year. Her busts are exploding.
