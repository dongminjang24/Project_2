"For people, stocks are a means of finance that starts with a small amount of money and makes a lot of money. And even at this time, new people are gathering to succeed in stock investment. However, people already knew even before they started the stock market that only a few people succeeded in the stock market.As only a few succeed, there are many investors who fail, and unfortunately, most of the investors who fail are investing in stocks for the purpose of recovering their principal.Even at this time, many people are trying their best to recover their principal, and you can see how many individual investors are trying to recover their principal by looking at the actual super ant-run portal site integrated stock cafe membership cafe.This cafe is a cafe with more than tens of thousands of members and is now a popular spot in the stock market with many individual investors joining. Mr. Lee, who runs this cafe, was introduced as a myth of billion success in most broadcasting and media, and became a hot topic.His success story is still legendary in the stock market, and his record of being the youngest analyst ever to be selected as the best expert in a short period of time after his success as a super ant is still unbroken.But he, who succeeded too early, has been skeptical about his analyst life and has since last year opened a securities cafe in Daum and Naver to help individual investors struggling with losses, recommending real-time events to people every day for free.The cafe, which first started as a club, is rumored to have a high hit and high return on free recommendations and many people recover their principal with free recommendations, and more than 10,000 members of Daum Cafe are still joining.His cafe bulletin board, which has become a hot spot for people who find him and now invest in stocks, has been flooded with praise, including a message that he bought a house thanks to his monthly profit of more than 1,000 won. Of course, if you look at this part alone, you can see a pleasant sight in the desolate stock market for the first time in a long time.However, no matter how many super ants recommend free sports, people gather, but the fact that more than one person a day joins every day means that there are many individual investors who are desperate, and the reality is that there are still many people who suffer from losses.Cafes are more inconvenient than sites, and just by looking at cafes, which are not even sites, becoming so famous, you can see how many investors struggle to make a profit.Even now, in order to help individual investors recover their principal every day, he/she recommends stocks for free at his/her cafe, known more as a billion-stock cafe than by its name, and finally said this.With the spread of the Internet, stock investment has been activated enough to be selected as the top of the financial technology rankings, but there is still a lack of services, and I started a free recommendation sport because I am sorry for this, and I am proud to thank so many people and will work harder in the future.Industry-specific analysis of the market: Space aviation, defense beverage, life insurance, shipping company, Big Tech, Trec, iKooksundang, Muhak R&L, Sammi, Thanol, Pungguk, Dongyang Life, Samsung, Hyundai, Sunheung, Ah, Shipping, Korea, Nocells, Bridge, S.Pam, Biosebals, Blue Net, Samsung ElectronicsKwon Dong Yang Securities Woori Investment & Securities Dongbu Securities Kyobo Securities Daewoo Securities Kiwoom Securities Semiconductor and Semiconductor Equipment Enspurun Electronic Mtech Vision QSI&C ITC Semiconductor Auditech Shimtek Comico DongALDEX OSST Telechips Shinseong F.A.C.E.G.Woo Techron.Borge IMTec.G.G.G.G.G.S.

"Investors are calling for caution as a number of companies have announced absurd correction disclosures after accounting firms' audit, saying their net profit for the period of sales or operating profit has drastically decreased or turned into deficits.With the introduction of the Korea Exchange's de-listing review system, it is interpreted that the audit of accounting firms has put a brake on the practice of properly preparing financial statements.Hanwha Tech announced a correction of its performance last year and announced that it recorded operating losses from operating profit of 100 million won. As a result, Huawei Tech has been in the red since last year. Net loss for the current term has also grown to 100 million won, an increase of about 10 million won from the previous 100 million won.An official from Huawei Tech dismissed it as just a correction announcement based on the results of an external audit, saying that non-operating costs increased due to the reflection of the valuation loss of the subsidiary's equity method.The deadline for submitting the audit report was originally due, but it was only submitted a day later in the morning.On the same day, Huawei Tech plunged to the price limit.After the market closed the previous day, KSR corrected that its net loss nearly doubled from KRW 100 million to KRW 100 million last year. An official from KSR explained that it was a correction following the end of the audit by an external auditor.For this reason, KSR was designated as a management item as the capital erosion rate reached . and trading was suspended until the end of the market on the same day. Ecopetro System, which announced that its net loss increased from KRW 100 million to KRW 100 million last year, was also designated as a management item and sales were suspended.Clasta Iljin Energy, an information technology component manufacturer, also belatedly reported the deterioration of its performance through a correction announcement.The deterioration of performance through correction disclosure is mainly seen in KOSDAQ companies. In particular, it is common in companies that are difficult to receive audit opinions.Accountants at major accounting firms said, ""With the delisting system in place, there is a growing tendency every year to stick to the principles of auditing,"" adding, ""The practice of preparing financial statements to suit the tastes of customers is gradually disappearing away.""Reporter Kang Jae-woong said, ""The cost of starting a coffee shop in Baepok-ri, Won-ga, is because Jung Joon-ho was born with a beautiful kiss like a wedding photo, but Um Ki-young was born in a different place, Gong Ji-young, Shin Jung-ah's essay, and so on.

"The stock prices of individual companies designated as investors' ventilation stocks are showing polarization.While the stock prices of companies with the largest shareholders expanding their stakes and new businesses rose to show trust to investors, companies suffering from a backlash due to malpractice charges plunged.According to the Korea Exchange, companies designated as investor-inspired stocks last month fell on average for 10 days after trading.

"The four Korea Exchange, which appeared in the studio of Kim Joo-young, a reporter for Money Today Broadcasting's Ministry of Economy and Securities, reorganized the KOSDAQ market's affiliated system on the last day and designated investor stocks. We would like to talk about what criteria the companies designated and what their positions are.Question When you say investment stocks, it literally means to be careful when investing. It means that the market is blacklisted and traded, but why did you introduce it? Yes, it was not easy for investors to notice the risk before it was designated as a management item or the reason for delisting occurred.The exchange said it has designated investor ventilation stocks so that investors can make careful investments on their own in advance.Question What companies have been designated as investment-oriented ventilation items? Investor-oriented ventilation items The exchange has designated corporate changes that are considered to have problems with corporate continuity and management transparency.There's a back.Originally, it was a dog event when I gave research service last year. As the condition of companies improved a lot in the financial statements for the business year, the number of stocks decreased.Questions. I don't think the stock price of these stocks was intact. It is no exaggeration to say that the stock price has fallen sharply since it was designated to pay attention to investment yesterday and today after the date was designated.Among the dog stocks, the price limit has fallen.In addition, individual stocks such as International DY, IDN, Ace, Hi-Tech, and Accuris reached an abnormal rate of decline rate of decline. The average rate of decline in individual stocks reached .Did any companies get a question? While individual stocks were shunned by investors, there were also some stocks that rose. Blue Gem D&C Matching Elsys went up.The exchange said that it is not convinced that the stock price has risen, although the designation as an investor's ventilation item requires attention to the continuity of the company and transparency of the company.Question What happens if these stocks continue to fall, but if they are designated as investor stocks, they will be subject to a real review of delisting if management changes occur or capital increase has been withdrawn to capital increase participants within months.Question It seems that damage to companies designated as investment stocks will be inevitable. I think there will be a lot of complaints from investors as well as the company concerned. Yes, most companies designated as investor ventilation items say their phones are not working. This is because there are a lot of protest calls from investors.The same goes for the exchange.

"There was an unprecedented situation in which a listed corporation asked the court to suspend the audit work of an accounting corporation in charge of accounting audits.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Ocean Global has applied to the Seoul Southern District Court for an injunction on the suspension of the audit work of the Seyoung accounting firm. Ocean Global explained the reason for the injunction, saying that Seyoung did not issue an audit report even though it delivered the revised financial statements to Seyoung Accounting Corporation during the re-audit period.Earlier, Ocean Global received a rejection of its audit opinion from Seyoung on last month. Since then, the company has changed its name from True Hour to the current Ocean Global and filed an objection to delisting, but it has not been accepted and has been decided to delist on Monday and started selling on Monday.However, he immediately applied for an injunction against delisting to the court and was immediately evicted thanks to its acceptance. On Monday, he also filed a lawsuit against the Korea Exchange to confirm the invalidity of the delisting decision.The revised financial statements were delivered to Seyoung and new audit opinions were awaited. However, Seyoung refused to submit an audit report. This is because the situation has not changed from the month when the audit opinion was rejected.The exchange's stance is still cold. An exchange official said, ""We gave an opportunity to explain after the rejection of the opinion, but there is no content to change the audit opinion,"" adding, ""We are encouraging Ocean Global to withdraw the lawsuit."" The official stressed that he plans to file a countersuit if the lawsuit is not withdrawn.Ocean Global, a management item, must be audited by an accounting firm designated by the Financial Supervisory Service. The Financial Supervisory Service, which designated Se-young as an external auditor of Ocean Global, says it will wait and see for now. An FSS official said, ""It is unclear whether the company's intention to sue is to avoid delisting or whether there is a problem with the accounting firm,"" adding, ""We are trying to figure out the background of the lawsuit.""

"As True Hour, which was designated as a management item early last year due to chronic pre-tax losses exceeding half of its equity capital, was on the verge of delisting due to less than KRW 100 million in market capitalization, major shareholders began to save True Hour.Moon Yeop-joong, who became a major shareholder by acquiring Manju with True Hour's new stock underwriting bonds with related parties last month, announced that he would give True Hour a small company he owned and receive hundreds of millions of won worth of new shares. After the issuance of new shares, Moon will become the largest shareholder with 10,000 shares of True Hour, including related parties.The investment is a method of giving a small company called Shinhan Precision owned by Moon for 100 million won and receiving new shares at face value. Shinhan Precision is a manufacturer of Samsung Electronics' mobile phone cases. Interestingly, the goodwill classified as an intangible asset accounts for more than 100 million won out of the company's value of 100 million won. In other words, the company's future profit value easily exceeded half of the total evaluation.A True Hour official said, ""We understand that the value was calculated through due diligence by the accounting firm, and the possibility of an increase in performance was highly appreciated.""When Moon said he would invest 100 million won, Il True Hour shares soared to the upper limit. The market capitalization increased from 100 million won to 100 million won in one day. If the current stock price continues for the time being, the first step has been properly made in line with the condition that the number of days with market capitalization of more than KRW 100 million should continue for more than days within days after the designation of the management item.The reason why the paid-in capital increase in self-allocation has been a positive factor is that Moon's investment is related to the management dispute.The main point is that Moon became a white knight when Human Living, the current largest shareholder with a current stake, announced its participation in management. In fact, Human Living is seeking to participate in intellectual management by taking over companies that are not related to its main job by spending a large amount of money on True Hour management.Therefore, it is observed that the company may have sent a signal to Moon to block Human Living's participation in management. However, Moon Yeop-joong, the party concerned, declined to comment, saying, ""I made a simple investment regardless of the management dispute.""Human Living also seems to have decided that it is better than delisting due to insufficient market capitalization.A Human Living official said, ""There seems to be no problem with Moon's investment. On the contrary, he said, ""It seems like we are receiving investment under good conditions,"" adding, ""We are positively discussing management participation through the appointment of directors at next year's shareholders' meeting.""True Hour, a company that builds an enterprise-wide resource management system, has been suffering from deficits since year.

The purpose of the investment was also changed from simple investment to management participation.The market is paying attention to the expansion of shares in True Hour, which is constantly noisy, such as the refusal to review the audit opinion on the fraudulent embezzlement of former CEO Kim Jae-hoe. The surge in stock prices is also attributed to expectations for the largest shareholders' participation in management and bypass listing in the future.However, Human Living says nothing has yet been decided on the details of the company's executives' participation in True Hour management or bypass listing.Human Living said that it still means exercising decision-making power based on the expansion of its stake. True Hour also said that it was only last month that Human Living first reported the ownership of True Hour shares.However, suspicions about the background of announcing participation in management at True Hour, which has been suffering from continued poor performance and management changes, have not subsided.True Hour, a software developer, started with Korea Computer System last year and was once incorporated into Chong Kun Dang's affiliate after switching its subsidiary to Korea's Hynix.However, the stake has continued to decline in the process of replacing the largest shareholder since its listing on the KOSDAQ last year.

Due to frequent replacement of CEO, performance has not escaped the swamp of deficit.Among the fiscal years, it was designated as a management item last year over the capital erosion rate for consecutive fiscal years. Last year, sales, operating losses, and net losses of 100 million won continued to be in the red.Since its listing on the KOSDAQ last year, its stake has continued to decline in the process of replacing its largest shareholder.

Human Living's estimated sales this year are worth 100 million won.Maidens, a related party to Human Living, is a company that operates consulting and others, and is listed as a joint investor.Meanwhile, True Hour could be delisted if such a reason occurs once again due to its refusal to review the audit opinion of the semi-annual report. In addition, former CEO Kim's fraudulent embezzlement complaint has been filed, so if the prosecution's indictment proceeds, it will also be considered whether it is subject to a substantive examination of the funeral.True Hour said that the allegations of former CEO Kim's embezzlement of fraud have yet to be confirmed internally.

"Neowave, a wired and wireless integrated access equipment manufacturer, said it would reduce capital reduction for free. The aim is to improve the financial structure. This is because the operating deficit is large and it is difficult to maintain the current capital.Neowave's sales last year were 100 million won, which was negative compared to the previous year. Operating profit is 100 million won and short-term net profit is 100 million won.When this became known, stock prices plummeted as disappointing sales poured in, falling to the lowest point in a row until the day.Ahead of the shareholders' meeting season, a series of KOSDAQ companies are trying to seek recovery through potatoes like Neo Wave.

The current stock price of Accuris, which will be listed next month, is only KRW.

Onse Telecom, a member of the Korea Electric Wire Group, has also failed to find a breakthrough in improving its performance due to its high dependence on external loans and cumulative losses.Onse Telecom recorded a cumulative deficit of 100 million won for the past year, followed by a deficit of 100 million won until the quarter of last year.True Hour, which issued a public announcement last month, has seen its stock price decline from the entire decision to the original level due to the news of the prosecution's investigation into the former management's alleged breach of trust.

Airparks and Gloworks are also managed items.Investors are required to pay attention even after the change listing, given that the company, which has deteriorated its management, has chosen a potato as a desperate measure.An official of the Korea Exchange advised, ""In the second half of last year, KOSDAQ companies that chose potatoes were eventually delisted,"" adding, ""If they are listed after capital reduction, stock prices will seem to have risen.High-end securities information service Renault's new concept car screenshot Galaxy and Galaxy Tab.

Featured by today's stock market",,,,
"Institutional investors are increasingly included in the so-called concentrated transaction cases of minority branches, in which the market price is driven by some investors. Most of these stocks are drawing attention as stock prices often soar and fall.Minority trading stocks are a system introduced by the Korea Exchange to prevent unfair practices in the stock market, and investment-oriented measures are taken.According to the Japanese securities industry, the total number of investment measures related to minority transactions announced by the Korea Exchange from this month to the end of last month was counted.This is a monthly average, which is more than a decrease from the first half. If the closing price rises or falls more than the closing price of the previous day, it is classified as a minority account transaction item.On top of that, if the transaction involvement rate at a particular point is higher or the upper opening point involvement rate is higher, it will be designated as a minority branch stock. Similar criteria apply to minority account concentrated stocks.What is characteristic of the second half of this year is that institutional investors' transactions are not boring.In the second half of this year, the cases in which institutions were included in minority transactions were True Hour Daewoo Parts Iljin DIA, Unitek Electronics, Keystone Global Curro Holdings, Dongshin Construction and SMT.Stock prices fluctuated significantly after institutional investors were included in minority transactions. True Hour's stock price, which was in the early stages of the original price, has risen to the won since mid-month when other corporations believed to be in the financial sector began to buy stocks. The corporation's involvement rate in the sale exceeded from month to day.Iljidia is also a case in which stock prices have soared due to the influx of institutional investors. As institutional investors' funds came in on Monday, the stock price, which was the previous day, rose to 10,000 won at the end of the month. In addition, Kuro Holdings, Dongshin Construction, and SMT showed the same trend.Keystone Global is an example of a sharp drop in stock prices after institutional investors' sales. Stock prices were around the won at the beginning of the month before the sale was made, but have now fallen to the original level. Daewoo Parts and Unitech Electronics also lost their stock prices significantly due to concentrated selling transactions by institutional investors.It can be interpreted from many perspectives that the number of minority branches or minority account transactions including institutions has increased. First of all, it can be interpreted that institutional investors with limited investment in large blue-chip stocks have expanded their investment areas to small and medium-sized stocks.A securities industry manager said, ""We are switching to small and medium-sized stocks because we are burdened by the recent excessive rise in large-cap stocks,"" adding, ""There are not many stocks, so even a small amount of buying capital tends to concentrate trading.""In some cases, corporate investors with small funds like savings banks enter. In other words, savings banks often invest in stocks linked to loan asset management, which may seem to concentrate transactions on some stocks.On the other hand, it is pointed out that there are many abnormal cases to see that the investment area of institutions has simply expanded to small and medium-sized stocks. For example, large funds are invested in companies with poor financial structures. Experts point out that it cannot rule out the possibility of unfair practices in managing stock prices with institutions' investment funds.

This is because the company announced late the previous afternoon that the former CEO was suspected of fraud and embezzlement.The damage to individual investors snowballed due to the low price on the day when not a single week was sold.

"The stock market's correction has been growing for two days. There is a lot of controversy over how to view this adjustment. Whether to view the adjustment as an opportunity for low-priced buying of blue-chip stocks or as an opportunity for risk management depends on the competence of investors.Experts Park Sang-hee, a master of mid- to long-term investment by blue-chip shareholders, revised his strategy with short-term adjustments in mind after the recent excessive index rise. Instead of the unconditional holding strategy of blue-chip stocks, stocks in the short-term excessive upward trend have been adjusted by appropriate selling.With the secured cash, it is seeking to re-buy low-priced blue-chip stocks representing the adjustment rights.Currently, the excuse for the stock market adjustment seems to be related to China's austerity. However, as China's austerity is not a new fact, our stock market has fully reflected vigilance and is expected to overcome pressure.Of course, it seems impossible to ignore the price burden of each stock in the stock market situation of the index's high notes. Against this backdrop, Park Sang-hee is continuing to maximize returns in the high-public stock market by properly controlling the preemptive volume of blue-chip stocks and re-buying low-priced stocks and responding quickly to stocks such as core stocks rather than the index.

"This article was shipped to the Professional Information Service created by Money Today on Monday.SQ Holdings has acquired Cellen S&N, a subsidiary of Hangeul and computers. SQ Holdings plans to change its company name and focus on its smartphone application business in the future.Cellen S&N made a public announcement that it has signed a transfer contract to transfer shares and management rights held by the largest shareholder to SK Holdings and others. Under the deal, Hancom, the largest shareholder, will hand over his stake in the company for 100 million won. The price per share is won. Considering that the closing price of Cellon S&N is the reason, the management premium is about .If you look at the major stake after the sale of Cellon S&N, Double H Partners, which has the largest stake in SK Holdings, will secure . In addition, Infinite Investor Park Seung-hoon and Cho Young-ki will each own .SQ Holdings paid 100 million won of the daily acquisition amount to Hancom, the largest shareholder, and received the will of the stocks subject to sale. It will then pay KRW 100 million in intermediate payments and receive 10,000 shares of stocks subject to sale a day before the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting on Monday. The balance must be paid by this year's date.Cellon S&N plans to appoint new executives through an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Monday. Park Seok-jeon, CEO of SK Holdings, is said to be the most likely CEO.SQ Holdings initially sought to acquire SevenCourse, but it broke down ahead of the final contract. Since then, Lee Hyuk-jae, a director of SK Holdings, has left the company and is seeking to acquire SevenCourse as an individual. Director Lee Hyuk-jae also acquired all bonds with new stock rights worth KRW 100 million issued by Seven Cosf on the last day.Both SQ Holdings and Seven Cospe are companies that have comprehensive consulting and financing contracts with TouchConnect, which is a manufacturer of smartphone applications. TouchConnect is a subsidiary of Dream Wiz, where CEO Lee Chan-jin belongs. This is why the securities industry considers SK Holdings' acquisition of Cellen S&N and director Lee Hyuk-jae's acquisition of Seven Cospe as CEO Lee Chan-jin's return to the KOSDAQ market. In response, CEO Lee Chan-jin draws the line that Park Seok-jeon and Lee Hyuk-jae are personally close, but the acquisition is completely unrelated to me.However, it is true that it has become easier to raise funds for Touch Connect through the acquisition of KOSDAQ-listed companies called Cellon S&N and Seven Cospe. Former CEO Park Seok-jeon and director Lee Hyuk-jae also do not deny that they have a financing contract with TouchConnect. Cellon S&N is also planning to add industries by producing smartphone applications in the future. The company is also planning to change its name accordingly.Park Seok-jeon, CEO of SK Holdings, said, ""The smartphone application industry has a bright future, but the reality is that there are no proper companies in Korea yet,"" adding, ""We will become a leader in the smartphone application industry through the acquisition of Cellon S&N.""Meanwhile, the sale of Hancom is also expected to gain momentum as the sale of Cellon S is successful. Cellon S&N has not been linked to Hancom's flagship office software business, so candidates for the acquisition have consistently demanded the sale of Cellon S&N. Chung Yong-jin seems to be controversial over the refund of tens of billions of won in transfer taxes from Bengha, who bought stocks so he couldn't see the house, and locked the door so he couldn't see the house.

"This article was shipped to the Professional Information Service created by Money Today on Monday.The acquisition of Hangeul and computers was eventually narrowed down to a wave of consortiums such as Hanlim Construction and Howie Consortium Soft Forum Hana Onneoflux Seven Cospparos Investment Korea Consortium. If the acquisition match of Hancom, which has been drawn since the beginning of last month, has been a practice game, the acquisition match from now on is actually the main game.As the price offered by candidate Gae does not show much difference, the key is how to raise funds for the acquisition from now on. In order not to fall into the winner's curse, it seems most advantageous to lower the proportion of external procurement as much as possible.Hallym Construction's Hauri Consortium, which was a hot topic in the early days of its participation in the acquisition of Hanlim Construction's Hauri, is showing its potential to be selected as a preferred bidder by dispelling concerns around it. As Hauri seems to complement Hallim Construction's insufficient software business experience, synergy is expected to be no problem after the acquisition. Hallym Construction Chairman Kim Sang-soo and Hauri CEO Kim Hee-cheon are known to be East-West.Analysts say that the Hallym Construction consortium has a relative advantage in raising funds for the acquisition. Hallim Construction has a vertical integration structure leading to Hallim Construction, Chairman Kim Sang-soo. As of the end of last month, Hallym Construction's consolidated cash and cashable assets were 100 million won. In the case of Howley, the cash available to mobilize as of the end of last month was about KRW 100 million, and if the two companies are combined, it will easily exceed KRW 100 million.In addition, Kim Hee-cheon, CEO of Hauri, is known to be a considerable wealthy person. CEO Kim's father is said to be the president of Kim Ye-hwan's Unhwa Institute, and owns a number of open schools such as Hwanil Middle School and Yale Girls' Middle School and buildings in Seoul.Compared to Hallym Construction, which injected fund funds held by Phoenix, the soft forum has less cash on its own. As of the end of last month, the soft forum's cash and cashable assets amounted to 100 million won, while short-term financial products amounted to only 100 million won. Its affiliate Darwin Tech's cash and cashable assets are KRW 100 million, short-term financial instruments KRW 100 million.The combined cash and short-term financial products of the two companies are only worth 100 million won. For this reason, the Soft Forum reportedly offered to Hancom that it would inject billions of won worth of fund funds held by its affiliate Phoenix Asset Management.On the other hand, it is an advantage that Soft Forum Chairman Kim Sang-chul has a number of experiences. Chairman Kim did all of the following: Soft Forum, a flagship company; Skem medical device company; Thumbtec bolt nut production company; Yuseong Metal company; IT+ semiconductor designer Darwin Taek.An industry source said, ""If we bring a sale to Chairman Kim, the rate of success is high,"" adding, ""The analysis of the sale is fast and once we make a decision, we push it forward with momentum."" Chairman Kim Jung-sil, a major shareholder of the soft forum and the wife of Chairman Kim Sang-chul, is also a wealthy man who has raised a lot of money through venture businesses and fund management in the U.S.The veiled Hana On consortium, Hana Neoflux Seven-Cospparos Investment Korea, is the most veiled candidate. After the acquisition, little is known about synergy creation and financing plans. It is said that Hana On, the representative of the consortium, has a personal relationship with the representative of each company.It is a company specializing in Hana On's case and real estate development. It was established in the Osong Life Science Complex for the development of residential officetels and venture business centers, apartment-type factory hotels, and cultural facilities. Major shareholders include Lee Woong, CEO of Dongshin Construction, and Lim Jae-gul, vice president of Maeil Dairy, Kim Jung-wan.Neoflux is an affiliate of Doosan Group, which holds a stake in Doosan. It plans to spend about 100 million won in the takeover bid. An official from Neoflux emphasized that it is only participating as a financial investor.The KOSDAQ-listed company Seven Cospe is a feed company that participated in a consortium to diversify its business. As of the end of last month, cash and cashable assets were KRW 100 million, short-term financial products were KRW 100 million, and cash that could be mobilized was KRW 100 million. Faros Investment is a Singapore-based investment company. Recently, there was a dispute with an English firm over the acquisition of management rights.

"Don't follow your dreams too much. Investments that are not supported by stability can suffer heavy losses at onceThis is what Rodeo Investment Club CEO Cho Moon-won always emphasizes to investors. CEO Cho cited the problem of corporate analysis, saying that not only ordinary investors but even analysts tend to focus on new growth projects rather than weighing the current profit value.He said that if you take too much weight of the uncertain future when you value it, you can't stand the nature of the stock market's volatility, and stressed that stability should always be kept in mind while comparing capital and market capitalization.As a result, CEO Cho is focusing on selecting undervalued stocks that have growth potential but have ridiculously small market capitalization compared to the company's current value while preparing for the New Year's briefing session. We judged that the stock market will show a positive trend this year as a shortcut to the investment briefing for small and medium-sized value stocks that Apgujeong Gyoju must buy. This is because the money released on the market has nowhere to go amid the current low-interest rate trend. CEO Cho is setting the KOSPI target before and after the securities firm. He explained that this year's large-cap stocks do not have much room to rise compared to last year, saying that they can only go as far as they can go and go beyond.In the end, he stressed that interest in marginalized small and medium-sized stocks will increase throughout last year, and that small and medium-sized stocks that are expected to benefit from the introduction of international accounting standards are of particular interest.By industry, we cited information technology, which has emerged as the winner of the automobile chicken game, which is increasing its global share, and textile paper industries that are breaking away from the prolonged slump.

"As interest in J-dong Telecom increases, some KOSDAQ companies are continuing to see their stock prices soar just by adding information and communication-related information to their articles of association or business purposes.As of Sunday afternoon, 7-Course was more than the previous day in the KOSDAQ market. It is trading at a higher won. Stocks rose above won during the trading day.In the market, speculation has been raised that 7-COSF may be preparing for the J-Dong carrier business after it added information and communication service business and WiBro equipment communication device sales business to its business purpose last month.However, Seven Coast denied rumors of entering J-Dong's business. An official from Seven Coast explained, ""The addition of the information and communication business for the purpose of the business is in consideration of the acquisition of Hangeul and computers, and is not directly related to J-Dong's business.""Recently, the stock prices of related companies have soared as news spread that they are preparing to apply for shareholder change to the Korea Communications Commission.JCOM was strong on the news that its holding company, C-Motech, will enter the J-Dong telecommunication business.At an extraordinary shareholders' meeting earlier this month, C-Motech added manufacturing of satellite communication devices related to information and communication and broadcasting businesses to its business purposes. Market watchers predict that J-Com will also benefit from C-Motech's participation in the J-Mobile telecommunication business.In addition, DBS' stock price recently soared on expectations of participation in the business, but turned to a sharp drop in work.However, it is pointed out that investment needs to be careful in that there is no specific fact that it has been revealed. Analysts say that regardless of the success of J-Mobile's business, it has soared only with expectations of participation. An official said, ""It is true that J-Dong has applied for a shareholder change, but we cannot disclose the specific participating companies yet.""

"The round of the acquisition of Hangeul and computers will begin. Cellen, the largest shareholder of Hancom, and its sales advisory firm will select preferred negotiators early next week at the latest and start full-scale sales. The preferred bidder is chosen as the location. This means that candidates for the acquisition must compete again on the same line.According to the Japanese securities industry, the acquisition of Hancom is likely to take place in a wave battle pattern, including the Soft Forum, Hallim Construction, and Hanaon Consortium.These are the places that offered more than 100 million won worth of Hancom's acquisition price. Cellen and others initially considered selecting the preferred bidder and the next preferred bidder, but turned to selecting multiple preferred bidder.This means that they will negotiate again on equal terms with all candidates selected as preferred negotiators. It is advantageous for Cellen to sell its stake, but candidates for the acquisition must compete fiercely again.An official familiar with Hancom's sale said, ""We have considered ways to negotiate with a large number of candidates simultaneously to determine the superiority and efficiency of the acquisition candidates,"" adding, ""We will officially announce the preferred bidder within next week at the latest.""Companies selected as preferred negotiators will be re-verified for management capability business synergy along with financing necessary for Hancom acquisition.The most important criterion is whether you have sufficient financial power. Cellen must abide by the debt repayment schedule discussed with creditors. Hancom can also operate stably only when its wallet meets a reliable owner. In other words, places that want to acquire Hancom with external loans or places with a large proportion of financial investors may be at a disadvantage.Stock markets are paying attention to the Hana On consortium among candidates for the acquisition. This is because Doosan Group is participating in the consortium.The Hana On consortium consists of Neoflux and Seven Cospe Hana On. Neoflux is a company owned by Doosan, the holding company of Doosan Group. Seven Cospe is a KOSDAQ company that participated in a consortium to diversify its business. Hanaon is a real estate investor.Stock markets are speculating that Doosan Group may acquire Hancom in the form of a consortium and purchase shares of consortium partners again to secure management rights. On the other hand, the business community is putting more weight on the possibility that Doosan Group participated simply in investment.An official from the business community said, ""Neoflux is a Doosan affiliate, but it is highly likely to be a simple investment in that it is a venture company,"" adding, ""If there was a prior consultation with Doosan Group, it could have put more meaning on Hancom acquisition.""

Neoflux is a Doosan affiliate that owns a stake in Doosan Group and specializes in Hana On and real estate development. The KOSDAQ-listed company Seven Cospe is a feed company that participated in a consortium to diversify its business.Meanwhile, Huawei's law firm, an advisory firm to Hancom's sale, said it received a letter of intent to acquire Hancom's shares and management rights.

"It is a word that makes my heart flutter when I hear the word golden wine that makes me rich. Any investor investing in stocks would have dreamed at least once. Even in economic newspapers and on the Internet, colorful articles about golden stocks, which have soared hundreds, make headlines.However, individual investors who followed and bought after hearing these articles and news, saying, ""Are you leaving me alone?"" rather than earning a return on their dreams, they become a clich챕 and cut in half. As such, the reality is that there are more people lost than those who made money in the stock market. Statistics show that the above individual investors have experienced failure, so stock investment is also difficult.The way to get on the right path of a tough investor, such as a journey to heaven, and to go easier and faster than others, is to meet a successful master. Meeting with a master who will look at the market correctly and make an accurate diagnosis gives novice investors a foothold to minimize mistakes and quickly adapt to the flow of the market.Which master is the real master? The rise and fall are repeated periodically, and bad news and good news appear alternately, and all of these situations can be seen clearly, and above all, it is the real master when it can give high returns to its members.The Internet pseudonym rich father, a veteran of stock investment years and recognized by the Korean economy as the best expert for years in a row, is therefore called a national analyst. He is famous for his outstanding and keen intuition that always reads the market one step faster than others. The rich father, who appeared in the show, recommends stocks through the market during the day and live broadcasting through his rich father's stock school, and the richest people in the country are receiving Royal Family membership services.However, it is helping individual investors by opening a rich father's stock cafe on a portal site so that small shareholders with relatively small investments can use it without any burden.The reason why many people still subscribe to the cafe, which is popular with individual investors with more than tens of thousands of members, is to see the free recommendations he recommends every day to help individual investors recover their principal.Korea Shipping Chemical, NCsoft, Sungji Construction, Hwa-shin, Kia Motors, Asiana Airlines, KPM Chemical, Hanilhwa Celltrion, which he publicly recommended to the cafe, have already made great profits by steadily recommending them from the bottom.His free recommendation can be found in Rich Dad's stock.There are many fake masters in the stock market without evidence. A real master is a real reference only to the person who shows the account.

"Most of them have been in the red for years, and it is rare to make actual profits at the end of the year, so listed companies, which have been in the red, have recently been in the midst of diversifying their businesses. Some KOSDAQ-listed companies, whose net profit for the period of operating profit continues to grow negative, are holding shareholders' meetings at the end of the year and pushing to add business purposes. The addition of business objectives is one of the annual events of the troubled KOSDAQ-listed companies.However, experts advise that investment in these stocks needs to be cautious because most of the added business sectors are far from the main business or do not actually proceed.According to the electronic disclosure of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Stormy & F will hold a shareholders' meeting this coming day.The main agenda is changes to the articles of incorporation of internal and external directors and auditors. In particular, due to the change in the articles of association, it plans to add telecommunications equipment and electronics manufacturing, wholesale and retail, import and export businesses, and agencies to approve standards in each country for business purposes.Stormi & F's operating profit and net profit for the quarter of this year recorded a net loss of KRW 100 million, respectively. It has been on a deficit march since last year.The World Tour, which will hold a shareholders' meeting on the same day, also plans to add real estate sales and rental clothing miscellaneous goods manufacturing, wholesale and retail electronics manufacturing, wholesale and retail and other service services to its business purposes. The world tour has been continuing its operating profit and net profit deficit from the year to the quarter of this year.Seven Cospe, which has been in the red since last year, is also planning to hold a general shareholders' meeting next month and add information and communication services such as content-related equipment rental, sales, and mobile Internet service development to diversify its business. Following its work, Corebreed will hold a general meeting of shareholders and put solar power projects on its list of business purposes. Corebreed's cumulative operating profit and net profit were 100 million won and 100 million won, respectively, until the quarter of this year-on-year. Also, it has never recorded a surplus since the year.In addition, EcoPetro System, which has been in the red since 2011, held a general meeting of shareholders and added solar cells and solar power generation systems for business purposes.An analyst at a securities firm said, ""Most of the business purposes added by companies that continue to suffer losses are far from the main business,"" adding, ""It is unclear how much effect the insolvent listed companies, which continue to suffer net losses in existing businesses, will have.""""Addition of business purposes of listed companies with negative growth is the same as regular year-end events,"" said a person in charge of corporate information at KOSDAQ market. The threat continues every day. To save fuel in winter, I rode Genesis without price bubbles, and I couldn't stand actress Lee Eung-kyung's adultery with so many men.

"Stock prices of companies, which had been expected to participate in J-Dong telecommunications companies by adding telecommunication businesses to the articles of association, fluctuated. Experts analyzed that the effectiveness of J-Dong's telecommunication business is suspected.On the KOSDAQ market in Japan, DS is higher than the previous day. It ended at a higher level.

In addition, Jacob rose.These companies have seen their stock prices soar and fall due to speculation that just adding information and communication-related information to the articles of association or business purposes may prepare for the J-dong carrier business.However, as the fact-checking on whether they are actually participating in the J-dong telecommunication company business has been delayed, there is a trend of waning sentiment.In particular, DBS' stock price rose sharply as it added related businesses to rumors and articles of association that it would become the largest shareholder at the beginning of the month. Stock prices have nearly doubled since rumors began to circulate at the beginning of the month, but the company has not given a clear answer.Experts pointed out that the effectiveness of J-dong Telecom's business itself is questionable. Choi Sung-hwan, a researcher at Yuhwa Securities, said, ""The government is pushing to cut telecommunication fees, but there may be controversy over reverse discrimination based on discount rates at existing mobile carriers, and the effect of using WiBro has not been proven yet.""

"Following the stock price trend, the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets are also showing signs of disintegration in leading stocks.Chemical steel distribution stocks, which have emerged as new shareholders in the KOSPI market, are not in the vein in the KOSDAQ market, while paper, telecommunications, food and beverage stocks, which have recently strengthened in the KOSDAQ market, are crying every day in the KOSPI market.According to the Korea Exchange, the chemical index rose in the KOSPI market from the first to the last day of the month. The Energy and Chemical Index, which consists of individual stocks such as Chemical Co., Ltd., is a chemical leader. It rose to the largest gainer in the KOSPI market during this period.By stock, large-cap stocks stood out. Hanwha Chemical rose close, and Hanwha and Hyosung, the holding companies of Hanwha Chemical, also rose side by side in the mid-to-late period. Taekwang Industrial Co., Ltd., which once reached the 10,000 won mark during the day, showed a strong rise in the rise.Unlike the KOSPI market trend, chemical stocks were clearly sluggish in the KOSDAQ market. The industry index fell, ranking at the top of the decline rate among individual industries.The decline rate of MNF, which was rejected, exceeded and Maxbro fell. Optical film manufacturers Shinhwa Intertek and Hanil Chemical Industries also fell.Retail and steel shares, which strengthened to . . in the KOSPI market during the same period, also lost face in the KOSDAQ market. The KOSDAQ market industry index showed negative growth rates, respectively.Large KOSPI stocks such as trading companies, Lotte Shopping, Hotel Shilla, and others rose in and out of the market, but distributors on the KOSDAQ market, including Taechang Paros, a food and materials distributor, and K&Company, an import and sale company, fell one after another.In steel stocks, older steel stocks such as POSCO, Hyundai Steel, Goryeo Steel, and Seabesteel, the KOSPI market share, showed a solid rise, while steel stocks such as Steel Flower Steel, Cheil Steel, fell sharply, showing no benefit from the improvement of the industry.Contrary to this trend, paper stocks played a leading role in the KOSPI market during this period, while the KOSDAQ market supported the index's The index of the paper industry in the KOSDAQ market. It recorded the highest growth rate following the publishing industry.Amid a surge in corrugated cardboard manufacturer Sanseong P&C, industrial filter paper producer Clean & Science Korea Packages, a manufacturer of paper products for food hygiene, also showed solid growth.On the other hand, Hansol Paper, Korea's largest paper maker listed on the KOSPI market, fell, and Korea Paper Youngpoong Paper Dongil Paper also performed poorly.

"After the weekly main inspection of Hallim Construction's Maeil Dairy Soft Forum, the market's interest in the preferred bidder is growing as the sale of Hangeul and computers has begun in the main game.According to Japan-related industries, Hanarion Consortium of Hallym Construction Consortium Soft Forum was selected as the preferred bidder for the acquisition of Hangeul and computers. The preferred bidder will offer the final acquisition price in the last week of the month through weekly due diligence starting next week.In particular, the preferred bidder selected this time is directly led by the chairmen of related companies, so until the final acquisition, there will be a game of pride for the chairmen.This article was shipped to E-Daily Market Point, a real-time financial and economic news terminal, at 1 a.m. Use E-Daily Market Point to preview E-Daily's high-end articles.Currently, Hanlim Construction Chairman Kim Sang-soo is known to be the most interested person in acquiring Hancom. Hallym Construction Chairman Kim Sang-soo spent 100 million won, the highest level, at the acquisition price of Hancom, and is burning his willingness to acquire the software company Hauri by participating in the consortium at the last minute.In addition, even executives of Hallym Construction, the main body of the acquisition, have made thorough preparations by keeping the related information secret, and are paying attention to the acquisition as they have replaced the acquisition advisory company in the middle.An official of Hallym Construction said, ""Even the representative, including the executives, had no idea about the acquisition of Hancom,"" adding, ""We confirmed through the media that Hanlim Construction is taking over Hancom.""Chairman Kim Sang-soo is also not worried in terms of financial power. Hallym Construction, which is no different from a private company, is known to have well over 100 million won in cash mobilization and the assets of its families around it are also significant.The Hana On Consortium, led by Maeil Dairy Chairman Kim Jung-wan, is also drawing attention.The Hana On consortium consists of Hana On, a real estate developer with Chairman Kim Jung-wan of Maeil Dairy, and Seven Cospe, a KOSDAQ-listed affiliate of Doosan Group. Currently, the Hana On consortium, like the Hallym Construction consortium, has proposed 100 million won at the acquisition price.At one time, interest in Doosan Group's direct acquisition grew, but Neoplux said it would only consider financial investment of about KRW 100 million in the consortium, so Hana On's acquisition of Hancom depends on Maeil Dairy Chairman Kim Jung-wan.Neoflux officials said they were not taking the initiative in the acquisition, but were merely considering participating as a financial investor. An official of Maeil Dairy also said, ""The acquisition of Hangeul and computers is a matter of personal will by the chairman,"" and added, ""I have never heard anything related to this.""Finally, the move of Soft Forum Chairman Kim Sang-chul, who is trying to acquire Hancom again, is also drawing attention. Chairman Kim, known as an expert on mergers and acquisitions, suffered a setback last year when he offered a lower price than Cellon during the sale of Hancom. However, Phoenix Asset Management, which operates a trust of more than trillion won, was acquired last month, and this time, it has offered an acquisition price of 100 million won.In the end, the acquisition of Hangeul and computers is expected to determine how quickly each chairman can judge and make a bold decision.An industry source said, ""If we look at the preferred bidder, the chairmen with considerable wealth are directly leading the acquisition,"" adding, ""There are likely to be quite a lot of variables based on the chairman's personal judgment.""

"C-Motech, which was on the verge of being expelled due to the rejection of an audit opinion, avoided delisting for now.The KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange announced that it will give IlC Motec an improvement period until this month to re-audit its financial statements last year.An official from C-Motech said, ""We were able to renew the contract with Shinyoung Accounting Corp. and improve it,"" adding, ""Anjin Accounting Corp., one of the big accounting firms in Korea, completed a new financial statement last year and signed a contract for Shinyoung to re-audit it.""In the disclosure of the submission of the audit report on last month, C-Motech made a reason for delisting by disclosing that the auditor's audit opinion on the financial statements for the recent business year was rejected.Since then, the company has submitted an objection to the delisting, and deliberations by the listing committee continued on the same day.However, granting an improvement period does not mean full rehabilitation. If the results of the re-audit are bad, they will eventually take steps to exit.In fact, even after the improvement period was over last year, Neo Semitech could not avoid rejecting its audit opinion and immediately began the delisting process.The KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange said that if the results of last year's re-audit of financial statements submitted within business days after the end of the improvement period are limited to rejection of audit opinions or restrictions on audit scope, it will be finally delisted.This also applies to cases where the re-audit contract is terminated in the middle of the recent business year and the re-audit report is not submitted by the deadline for submission during the improvement period.

"While C-Motech is seeking a re-audit to avoid delisting, its consolidated financial statements have been submitted virtually blank, sparking controversy. The Korea Exchange has asked C-Motech to submit documents to decide whether to maintain its listing by the upcoming date.According to the Japanese electronic disclosure, the consolidated financial statements were not attached to the consolidated audit report submitted by C-Motech at the end of last month. In other words, there is no performance data that integrates C-Motech and its subsidiaries.The industry says that it is difficult to prepare a consolidated audit report. JCOM, a subsidiary across the street, completed the audit normally in its settlement last year, but it has since gone bankrupt and has now been withdrawn from the stock market. It is virtually impossible to handle normal work because a considerable number of employees have retired and only a minimum number of people remain for liquidation. The withdrawal of funds through Jacob also fell through.Shinyoung Accounting Corp., which refused to comment on C-Motech's financial statements last year, did not express its opinion in the consolidated audit report, saying, ""The company's managers are responsible for preparing the consolidated financial statements, but they did not receive the necessary data."" The explanation is that the audit was not conducted due to the limitation of the scope of the audit.Internally, it is not in a position to pay attention to subsidiaries. C-Motech has signed an audit contract to be audited again last year's financial statements that were rejected. However, the situation is not easy enough for shareholders to spend 10,000 won, which is half of the 10,000 won down payment related to financial statements services. The accounting firm is feeling burdened enough to demand the exclusion of external pressure from shareholders or companies during the audit process.Against this backdrop, the Korea Exchange plans to receive related documents to review the listing of C-Motech, which was decided to be continued last month. If the improvement order period is received in the future review, it will have the last chance to revive through re-audit, but otherwise, the possibility of being kicked out cannot be ruled out.

"C-Motech, which has fallen into the prey of corporate hunters and is on the verge of delisting the CEO's suicide, is seeking a comeback through corporate rehabilitation procedures.C-Motech made a public announcement that the Seoul Central District Court has decided to commence rehabilitation procedures.The reporting period of stocks or investment shares of rehabilitation bond rehabilitation security rights or shares is from the date of month to the date of the first related person's meeting.Kim Sung-jin, who was appointed as a management manager by C-Motech's board of directors at the end of last month to deal with the crisis, and Jin Young-joon, who was selected by the court, will be jointly in charge.The decision to start the rehabilitation process comes after Kyung Eun Mutual Savings Bank, a creditor of C-Motech, applied for the commencement of the rehabilitation process last month.Kyung Eun Mutual Savings Bank also received an application for a company property preservation disposition order and an application for a comprehensive prohibition order.Kyung Eun Mutual Savings Bank, based in South Gyeongsang Province, including Ulsan, invested KRW 100 million last year when C-Motech issued KRW 100 million worth of bonds with warrants.Following the court's decision to start the rehabilitation process, C-Motech has secured an opportunity to seek a comeback even if it is delisted.The corporate rehabilitation procedure is a corporate restructuring procedure under the management of the court. It proceeds when it is judged that saving the company is higher than its value when liquidating and there is a possibility of rehabilitation.C-Motech will submit a rehabilitation plan through consultation with creditors. If creditors reject it, the rehabilitation procedure will be abolished.C-Motech minority shareholders are currently in a position to actively reflect their voices in the process of corporate rehabilitation in the future, as they have gathered voting rights of 10,000 shareholders.A C-Motech official said, ""As there is a consensus that reviving the company is an urgent priority, we expect smooth adjustment.""The KOSDAQ Market Headquarters of the Korea Exchange made a decision to continue C-Motech at a listing committee held on the last day. The accounting firm, which previously notified C-Motech of its rejection of the audit opinion, reportedly submitted a letter of intent to re-audit to the exchange. If the listing committee, where the exchange continues, does not accept the re-audit, C-Motech will immediately enter the exit clause.The prosecution is currently investigating a case in which executives and employees of C-Motech accused the real owner of Namu Equity, the largest shareholder, of embezzlement and breach of trust.Kim and Lee, real owners of Namu Equity, are suspected of siphoning off billions of won from C-Motech and J-Com, a subsidiary of C-Motech.Known as corporate hunters, they acquired WiBro data modem maker C-Motech last year through a capital-free acquisition method. After acquiring JCOM, a bio company, it even pushed for the acquisition of Samhwa Savings Bank earlier this year.Seo Tae-ji, a high-end securities information service that is not available on the news, is on the brink of a stock market where the company confronts a new car, the 10,000 won Grandeur, following Chan BobMorgan luxury sports car Ferrari accident, current professional baseball player, housemate, suicide, Twitter spread, successful investment Today's recommended stock price is small and medium-sized stocks Today's real-time news money is prohibited",,,,
"The rejection of the audit opinion resulted in the reason for delisting, but the fate of the individual companies that raised objections and sought recovery will be determined. Along with the representative suicide scandal, C-Motech, which is under investigation by the prosecution for embezzlement and breach of trust, is the target.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, a listing committee will be held from the morning of the day to decide whether to expel individual companies of Science Nice Metal D-Fashion Geno System Ecosolution C-Motech.The listing committee will make a final decision on the withdrawal of companies that raised objections after the reason for delisting occurs or give them an improvement period.Just as the results of the listing committee for individual companies were announced on the same day, all individual companies will be announced on the same day. The listing committee, which was held on the last day, decided to delist all individual companies.Among the individual stocks subject to review by the listing committee, other companies, except for Defashion, which is inappropriate for audit opinions, were rejected by external auditors, resulting in reasons for delisting. As the opinions of external auditors were the reason for delisting, the re-audit contract and future plans to resolve them are expected to be decisive factors in whether to decide to leave.According to the Korea Exchange, none of the companies submitted a re-audit contract as of 1 a.m. Only C-Motech and Eco Solution submitted a letter of intent to re-audit.In this regard, C-Motech's minority shareholders announced the preparation of various documents through the stock portal Paxnet stock bulletin board and announced that they would submit a re-audit contract to the Korea Exchange before that day, but none were received to the exchange until minutes ago.The submission of the re-audit contract does not mean that the improvement period can be granted. Among the dog stocks that were decided to be kicked out on the last day, G&R Cheil Changtu, the opening of Ocean Global, submitted a re-audit contract. This means that submitting a re-audit contract is not a sufficient condition for rehabilitation.An official of the Korea Exchange said, ""If the audit is conducted after a certain period of time, whether it is months or months, the improvement period will be given only when the plan for the re-audit is fully explained.""Some companies have delayed delisting at the edge of the cliff. Cheil Chang-Tu and Ocean Global, which went into liquidation due to the listing committee's decision to delist on the last day, postponed delisting through an application for disposal of the delisting site. Even if the accounting firm's re-audit results in an appropriate audit opinion in the future, it will have to win the lawsuit filed with the court and will have to go through another listing committee.PLC, which caused the delisting due to the erosion of full capital in the last business year, was decided to be subject to a substantial review of delisting as it submitted an audit report that resolved the total capital erosion through self-rescue efforts. An official of the Korea Exchange said, ""The company submitted an audit report that eliminated the complete erosion,"" and explained, ""In this case, the company will decide its future actions through the delisting review committee without resolving the suspension of transactions at once.""

"C-Motech's minority shareholders are continuing their tearful moves to urge the re-audit of Shinyoung Accounting Corp.C-Motech's minority shareholders visited the Financial Supervisory Service on the last day and returned after delivering their opinions to Shinyoung Accounting Corp. to cooperate in accepting the re-audit. Prior to this, they gathered in front of C-Motech's headquarters in Seocho-gu, Seoul, and held a sit-in to urge the re-audit of the Shinyoung accounting firm to normalize the company.An official of the minority shareholders' group said, ""We don't know why Shin Young doesn't accept the re-audit, even though the prosecution's investigation is able to find out the actual situation of the fund transaction while suing Namu Equity, the largest shareholder, for embezzlement and breach of trust.""In a telephone interview with a journalist, Shinyoung CEO Jang Hak-kyu said, ""We have no plans to officially conduct a re-audit by C-Motech's individual shareholders,"" adding, ""We have no plans to conduct a re-audit yet.""CEO Jang added, ""It is a very unfortunate issue to hear the reasons of individual shareholders, but it is not common to go into re-audit after the audit is completed.""Regarding the reason why he did not attend the regular shareholders' meeting of C-Motech at the end of last month, he explained that he would go to the general shareholders' meeting if there was an official request from the company under the External Audit Act.Regarding the closing of the company's offices, which some minority shareholders claimed, the accounting firm generally said, ""The workload is at a murderous level until the end of the month,"" adding, ""We moved to a nearby office because it was difficult to handle the work in a situation where some minority shareholders protested.""CEO Jang said that the minority shareholders have notified them of the visit today, adding that he will meet with minority shareholders to explain the company's situation and talk. Meanwhile, an official from the Financial Supervisory Service said, ""The audit authority of an accounting firm is an independent authority,"" adding, ""The supervisory authority cannot officially request an audit of the accounting firm.""Hankyung Dotcom Choi Sung-nam Journalist's Samsung Bae Hankyung Star Wars Real-life Investment Competition Opens Hankyung Premium Hidden Radiation Material Subsequent beneficiaries exercise copyright under the Korea Online Newspaper Association's Digital News Usage Rules",,,,
"C-Motech minority shareholders are increasing the pressure to urge the re-audit of Shinyoung accounting firms.A delegation of minority shareholders said, ""It is irresponsible for Shinyoung Accounting Corporation to refuse the re-audit, saying that it has yet to show its willingness to accept the re-audit even though the reasons for rejection of the audit have been resolved.""In submitting an audit report last month, Shinyoung Accounting Corp., an external auditor of C-Motech, expressed its rejection of the audit opinion, saying that the adequacy of financial transactions due to C-Motech's vulnerability in internal control procedures was not secured and the audit scope was limited.An official of the minority shareholders' group said, ""We don't know why Shin Young doesn't express his intention to re-audit even though the prosecution's investigation is able to find out the actual situation of the fund transaction by suing Namu Equity, the largest shareholder who actually controlled the funds.""The official explained that the substance and appropriateness of the fund transaction could be confirmed as the creditor, Kyung-eun Mutual Savings Bank, has applied to the Seoul Central District Court for the commencement of the rehabilitation process. The reason for limiting the scope of the audit, which Shinyoung Accounting Corporation claimed, has been largely resolved, and it is necessary to conduct a transparent audit of the company.The market expressed concern that even if the flow of funds is confirmed as the scope of the audit, which was the reason for rejecting the audit opinion, could again express the rejection of the audit opinion due to uncertainty of the company. It is judged that it will not be enough to prevent the mourning.An accounting firm official said, ""Even if Shinyoung starts a re-audit, if more debt is determined or contingent liabilities are found due to uncertainty, the auditor may raise questions about the continuity of the company and eventually raise negative or negative opinions.""Meanwhile, C-Motech's minority shareholders will hold a sit-in at C-Motech's headquarters later in the day to urge the company to normalize and re-audit its Shinyoung accounting firm.Hankyung Dotcom Choi Sung-nam Journalist's Samsung Bae Hankyung Star Wars Real-life Investment Competition Opens Hankyung Premium Hidden Radiation Material Subsequent beneficiaries exercise copyright under the Korea Online Newspaper Association's Digital News Usage Rules",,,,
"Small shareholders of C-Motech will hold a rally in front of C-Motech's office building in Gangnam on Sunday afternoon to request the delisting of C-Motech and the granting of a related improvement period.An official from the minority shareholders' delegation said Dawn shareholders will gather to ask the Financial Supervisory Service Korea Exchange's Shinyoung Accounting Corp. to grant improvement periods and re-audit contracts.Since the prosecution's investigation is currently underway and court receivership has been applied, the Soju team's position is to give a period of improvement only in the meantime as all the problems may be revealed in future investigations.They originally planned to hold a rally in front of the Korea Exchange in Yeouido or in front of the Financial Supervisory Service, but they were forced to hold a rally in front of the C-Motech office in Gangnam because the rally report was already full in Yeouido.According to Soju Group, the current stake secured by Soju Group is more than the previous day.A Soju group official also said, ""We know that C-Motech has sent an official letter to Shinyoung Accounting Corp., an external auditor, asking for a re-audit,"" adding, ""We will urge Shinyoung Accounting Corp. to sign a re-audit contract.""

C-Motech said in a public announcement that Kim and Lee are believed to have caused financial losses to the company by managing C-Motech's corporate seal and bank accounts, causing about 100 million won in property damage, including the seizure amount.Namu Equity, a special purpose corporation for mergers and acquisitions, has been pointed out as the starting point for C-Motech to break down, but its substance has not been revealed so far.Officially, it is known as a corporation established by Jeon and Myung, known as the nephew-in-law of President Lee Myung Bak, with a capital of 10,000 won. However, there have been rumors in the market that Jeon is just a face-to-face conversation to incorporate theme stocks and that the actual owner is separate. However, the name of the actual owner was officially mentioned this time.Stock industry sources say Kim and Lee, who were accused of embezzlement and breach of trust, are connected to the big hands of the private loan market. There are also rumors of a gang connection. They seem to have made profits in a typical way by raising acquisition funds from the bond market and paying back the acquisition funds with the company's money after taking over the company.It is also suspected that it may have raised stock prices by setting the wind to be incorporated into theme stocks or siphoned off the funds by raising funds from individual investors through a paid-in capital increase. Namu Equity announced that it borrowed KRW 100 million in private loans when it acquired C-Motech in the month of last year. It also raised 100 million won in paid-in capital last month.An industry expert said, ""The C-Motech scandal is a typical example of turning a company into a shell,"" adding, ""Kim and Lee are already known in the industry and are related to other companies.""Meanwhile, JCOM, a subsidiary of C-Motech, will be delisted.

"It turned out that there was an expedient of embezzlement and breach of trust in the background of the C-Motech case, which caused a stir in the market due to the suicide of the CEO of a KOSDAQ company.C-Motech announced that Namu Equity, the largest shareholder of the day, and Kim Chang-min and Lee Chul-soo, the real owner, were charged with embezzlement and breach of trust.In a public announcement, the company said that Kim and Lee are believed to have caused financial losses to the company by managing C-Motech's corporate seal and bank accounts, causing about 100 million won in property damage, including the seizure amount.Stock market watchers predict that the embezzlement of Kim and Lee's group will exceed the maximum amount of KRW 100 million amid a series of governance structures leading to Namu Equity C Motec J.COM J&C Holdings.C-Motech and its subsidiary J&C Holdings have reportedly secured a total of 100 million won until recently, but the whereabouts of the money are unknown.C-Motech secured 100 million won through a paid-in capital increase that began work at the end of last year and ended early this year.

The general shareholders' agenda is approval of financial statements, approval of directors' audit remuneration limits.Since the last day, minority shareholders of C-Motech have launched minority shareholders' meetings through online and offline communities and have conducted voting rights delegation.An official from the minority shareholders' meeting said that Dawn secured a stake close to participation in two days. Currently, Namu Equity, the largest shareholder of C-Motech, has a stake as of the end of last year, and the minority shareholders' meeting expects that it will be able to push for normalization of its management mainly by minority shareholders.An official from the minority shareholders' meeting said, ""We will do our best to save the company,"" adding, ""We will take legal action against those responsible if the company is delisted.""As of the end of last month, C-Motech had 10,000 rights shareholders. In addition, the damage is expected to be even greater considering the successful capital increase in the general public offering of forfeited shares after the allocation of shareholders worth KRW 100 million last month.C-Motech was previously notified by an accounting firm on the last day of its rejection of audit opinions due to restrictions on the scope of audit, resulting in a reason for delisting. Kim Tae-sung, CEO of the company, threw a shock at the end of his life by suicide.C-Motech plans to receive an objection to delisting next month and request a re-audit of an accounting firm. C-Motech will hold a board meeting Sunday afternoon to appoint a representative to replace its obituary CEO.However, if the accounting firm rejects the audit opinion again, C-Motech is expected to be delisted and the damage will be entirely attributed to minority shareholders.Inaccessible high-end securities information service, Sangseobon, Mt.

"Small shareholders of C-Motech, which are on the verge of being kicked out, are moving to secure management rights.According to the Japanese securities industry, minority shareholders of C-Motech, which are facing multiple unfavorable factors such as refusal of audit opinions and suicide of the CEO, are joining forces by transferring their holdings around Nevis Stock, a securities investment information community.The current number of shares transferred, known on the C-Motech bulletin board of Paxnet, is Manchuria, with a total of minority shareholders participating. In particular, the number of transferred stocks is expected to increase significantly in the future as minority shareholders continue to post that they have transferred stocks.The purpose of the stock transfer of minority shareholders, which is currently known, is to take over management rights and have the company submit audit reports again to escape the extreme situation of delisting.Ma Jong-hoon, head of the Nevis Stock team, said, ""We held our first meeting on the previous day and opened a shareholder committee in Nevis Stock. Shareholders are currently considering taking over management rights and are asking the company to submit a re-audit report to maintain its listing.""C-Motech is a company that caused the reason for delisting due to the rejection of the audit opinion on the past, and thousands of minority shareholders are on the verge of massive losses.According to last year's quarterly report, minority shareholders below the shareholding ratio are bright. On top of that, considering the number of general public offering paid-in capital increase subscriptions after the allocation of shareholders, the number of affected shareholders is expected to reach 10,000.Meanwhile, Dawn, an investor who was affected by the issuance of corporate bills before the start of the rehabilitation process, gathered in front of Holdings' headquarters in Gangnam, Seoul, to protest against the group. They criticized the group's immoral behavior, such as issuing a monthly maturity of 100 million won just 10 days before the application for court receivership to pay back investment securities from affiliates.Reporter Ahn Hyun-duk...I can't stand the humiliation of Hyundai Motor, a popular Korean I-dot-com article Korean university students, who are highly praised for their skills, worked hardIt's like avoiding sex trafficking in a woman who cleverly disguised herself as a sex trafficker, and she's scared to have a baby because of the poor performance of the Japanese superpower Korean company Are you curious about the winning rate of Alpha Club's leading event?",,,,
"Up to 10,000 shareholders are expected to suffer damage if C-Motech, which has been delisted due to the rejection of the audit opinion, is expelled from the KOSDAQ.According to the Japanese securities industry, the real number of shareholders of C-Motech as of last year-on-year. Considering that C-Motech completed a large-scale paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million earlier this year, the number of shareholders will increase further. The total number of subscriptions was made. When these numbers are added together, the number of shareholders can reach up to 10,000. C-Motech has more than a minority shareholder ratio. If kicked out, the damage will be handed over to individual investors.The number of affected shareholders of C-Motech is expected to be the largest in KOSDAQ history. The number of minority shareholders of Neo Semitech, which stirred up the KOSDAQ market last year, was only dawn.Neo Semitech was delisted last year due to the rejection of audit opinions and was given a month-long improvement period, but eventually was kicked out of the KOSDAQ market because it failed to prevent rejection of opinions. At the time of exit, Neo Semitech's market capitalization was around 100 million won, which is ahead of C-Motech's current level of 100 million won. However, C-Motech has more minority shareholders. In other words, a wide range of investors suffered losses. For this reason, if delisted, strong opposition from individual investors is expected.C-Motech was rejected by an accounting firm on the last day and the reason for delisting occurred. CEO Kim, who led the company, attempted suicide two days later in the evening and eventually died. According to the regulations, if an objection is not filed by the transaction date after the reason for delisting occurs, the abolition process will proceed.For this reason, C-Motech is expected to be able to revive by submitting an objection to the reason for delisting to the exchange by the coming month. Following Kim's death, C-Motech plans to appoint a new CEO through the board of directors and submit related documents before the deadline.As many investors are in a situation to suffer damage, C-Motech minority shareholders are also moving faster. They have been preparing for collective action since C-Motech received a rejection of its audit opinion from Shinyoung Accounting Corp. The final goal is to prevent delisting, but it also seems to be to secure management rights.According to the stock discussion bulletin board of Paxnet C-Motech, a representative shareholder meeting of In, who represents minority shareholders, has been formed since the past days. They have been working hard to resolve the situation by visiting the headquarters of C-Motech, a Shinyoung accounting firm, and are announcing it on the bulletin board.Shareholders are in a position to push for the acquisition of management rights at the general shareholders' meeting to be held on the coming day. In other words, it will secure management rights through vote competition by acquiring the above voting rights. As the stake of Namu Equity, the largest shareholder, is only large, it is not an impossible scenario if minority shareholders unite.To this end, the discussion board on the company has been posting articles on the stock transfer procedure, which calls for delegating stock certificates through Navistak and Hana Daetoo Securities from work.In addition, minority shareholders are criticizing Jeon Jong-hwa, known as the representative of Namu Equity, the largest shareholder of C-Motech, for an investigation into Shinyoung Accounting Corporation, which was an external auditor of C-Motech. In particular, it is demanding the rejection of the audit opinion and the fact-finding of the largest shareholder's allegations that led to the death of the representative.

"Refuse to thank you.C-Motech shareholders were shocked by the sudden death of the CEO when minority shareholders attempted to secure management control of the regular shareholders' meeting. Last year, a company that won a billion dollars export tower was unexpectedly rejected by the audit opinion, and the tragedy of the CEO's suicide occurred.Minority shareholders seem to be in a hurry to respond, saying they cannot be devastated. The goal is to secure management rights by collecting stakes before the regular shareholders' meeting on this coming day and normalize the company.It's a sign of anxiety from work.Kim, CEO of C-Motech, a KOSDAQ-listed company, was found dead in his car last evening. According to company officials, the police tentatively concluded that the cause of death was suicide. A suicide note was also reportedly issued in the car.It was in the past that the company began to show strange signs. The report was not submitted even though the deadline for submitting an audit report has passed. As investors' anxiety was mounting, the Korea Exchange called for an inquiry into the inappropriate audit opinion theory.Until this time, shareholders had some hope. According to the company's announcement on the last day, its operating profit was KRW 100 million last year, turning into a surplus compared to the previous year. It was speculated that the submission of an audit report may be delayed due to a simple delay in submitting data, if the deficit is not severe.However, the result of the report released that afternoon was a rejection of the audit opinion. The reason is that the substance and adequacy of important fund transactions cannot be confirmed due to the vulnerability of the company's internal control procedures. Since the rejection of the audit opinion constitutes a reason for delisting, the Korea Exchange immediately designated C-Motech as a management item and suspended stock trading.The news of the CEO's death was reported last weekend, when shareholders were still shocked by the rejection of the audit opinion. Not only shareholders but also company officials are embarrassed by the unexpected situation.An official of the company said, ""We first heard of the incident through reports over the weekend,"" adding, ""We are currently considering taking measures and will announce the company's official position as soon as possible.""Although C-Motech won the export top of Billion U.S. dollars, C-Motech was listed on the KOSDAQ market last month. It has mainly produced portable Internet access devices that allow portable terminals such as laptops to access the Internet using mobile networks.He also showed signs of recovery by ending his contract for foreign exchange derivatives products last month and winning a billion-dollar tower at the ceremony marking the International Trade Day.However, the industry believes that excessive business expansion has hampered the company. Last year, it spent more than 100 million won to acquire JCOM, a bio company, and participated as a major shareholder in Korea Mobile Internet, which is pursuing its mobile communication business.In this month, the company sought to acquire a savings bank through its subsidiary JCOM with 100 million won, but failed. Such excessive business expansion required funds. C-Motech conducted a monthly paid-in capital increase of 100 million won last year, and also conducted a paid-in capital increase of 100 million won this month in the name of research and development.The industry believes that there is a possibility that problems such as embezzlement may have occurred in the process of financing and execution of the company. The vulnerability of fund management, which is the reason for the rejection of audit opinions by accounting firms, also proves this.An industry source said, ""It is highly likely that it is a fund management problem that takes issue with internal control procedures rather than financial statements themselves,"" adding, ""Shareholders who participated in the capital increase without knowing the circumstances.""Busy minority shareholders.Shareholders, who have become inevitable due to the crisis of delisting C Motec, which attempts to secure management rights, quickly began to come up with measures.The plan is to secure management rights by collecting shares of minority shareholders around securities boards. The goal is to proceed with the regular shareholders' meeting scheduled for this coming day and to overcome the difficulties by reorganizing the board members of the acquisition of management rights. It also intends to take legal measures such as compensation for damages after taking over management rights in the future.However, experts say that there is not much that minority shareholders can do other than exercising individual voting rights at the regular shareholders' meeting.The explanation is that there is not enough time left and the immediate shareholders' meeting has to be followed by legal procedures, but in reality, it is difficult to prepare procedures such as acquiring management rights.There is also a slim chance that the company will exit the delisting. C-Motech will begin the delisting process if an objection is not filed by the due date when the reason for delisting occurs on the last day. However, the company has not submitted any data or objections to the exchange.An official of the exchange said, ""The objection is irrelevant to whether the CEO is a director or not, but it is not easy to correct the delisting because the reason for the delisting is about the audit opinion,"" adding, ""In order for the objection to be accepted, it should contain clear information that can be received as an audit opinion.""""Even if an objection is cited, the transaction will be suspended until it is properly received through a re-audit,"" he said, adding, ""Even in the past, there are few cases where the audit opinion has changed from rejection to appropriateness.""

"Attention is focusing on whether C-Motech, which has been mired in the death of the CEO of the company's money seizure due to the refusal of opinions on the audit report, will be able to escape the stock market. Minority shareholders, whose participation in the paid-in capital increase has aggravated the damage, have sought legal action as well as participation in management through aggregation of voting rights.C-Motech plans to convene a board of directors within this week, when the funeral of the late CEO Kim Tae-sung is completed, to set up a center point to overcome the crisis of appointing the new CEO.It also plans to submit an objection to the delisting to the Korea Exchange next month to avoid delisting. C-Motech is reportedly requesting a re-audit to Shinyoung Accounting Corp.C-Motech has been seized with money and furniture the next day after receiving a notification of rejection of opinions from an audit reporter by an accounting firm. No monthly salary was paid for this month for executives and employees.With the funding chain tied up, C-Motech is pinning hope on the possibility of normalizing the company through operations that are operating normally. C-Motech succeeded in turning into a surplus last year as its annual operating profit surpassed 100 million won. Cumulative sales in the same quarter of the same year also surged about times compared to the same period last year and nearly doubled from annual sales in the previous year.Last month, he won the billion-dollar tower at the ceremony marking the International Trade Day.The cumulative operating profit for the quarter of last year also turned into a surplus of 100 million won. However, as of the end of the month, cash flow from operating activities was less than 100 million won, and net profit was only 100 million won. In other words, they sold products worth 100 million won per month, but only a small amount of cash was held.Even if C-Motech undergoes a re-audit by an accounting firm in the future, if its opinion is repeatedly rejected or the stock market is decided to be withdrawn by the substantive review committee for delisting, even the company's operations will inevitably be severely disrupted.An official from C-Motech expressed concern that if the listing is abolished, the development of new products based on Long Term Evolution, which have been developed with domestic mobile carriers, is likely to be stopped and overseas exports will be hit hard.In a situation where the future is uncertain, C-Motech shareholders have vowed to launch a meeting of minority shareholders through the online and offline communities and voice their normalization of the company by participating in management rights. Voting rights delegation is currently underway for minority shareholders.Many of these minority shareholders are suffering from the recent fall in stock prices, which has added to their existing stock holdings and the paid-in capital increase worth KRW 100 million last month. At that time, after the allocation of shareholders, the subscription rate of the old shareholders reached . in the capital increase for the general public offering of forfeited shareholders.C-Motech's minority shareholders said they will normalize the company by forming a CEO and board that shareholders and executives and employees can fully understand by holding a shareholders' meeting on the coming day, adding that they will also take legal measures such as compensation for damages caused to shareholders.If C-Motech submits an objection to delisting as scheduled and goes through the re-audit process, the final delisting will be determined sometime next month.High-end securities information service not accessible by the news, went to the rescue of a suicide CEO of C-Motech Korea's Mark Zuckerberg Pyo Chul-min's success and frustration The extreme choice of Kia's new ride sports car following Elan...Small and medium-sized stocks are recommended today for small and medium-sized stocks.

"Kim Tae-sung, CEO of C-Motech, who was driven to the brink of delisting, turned his back on the world by suicide. Some have raised rumors of pressure from some private loan funds raised when acquiring C-Motech, but the specific cause of CEO Kim's extreme choice has yet to be revealed.As a result, interest in Namu Equity, which CEO Kim represented, has also been increasing, as it is the starting point of the merger of non-capital companies from the acquisition of C-Motech last year to the acquisition of savings banks earlier this year.Namu Equity is a special purpose company for mergers and acquisitions with a capital of 10,000 won established by Jeon last month.Last year, CEO Lee Jae-man, the largest shareholder of C-Motech, a KOSDAQ-listed company that produces data modems for mobile communications, held talks with Taechang Enterprises last year on the sale of their shares.C-Motech received KRW 100 million in due diligence deposits from Hyundai Metal, the parent company of Taechang Company, but negotiations on the final sale price broke down. Jeon, who had a personal acquaintance with the CEO of Taechang Enterprise at the time, succeeded to the contract.Namu Equity eventually signed a main contract with CEO Lee in the month of last year to transfer C-Motech shares and management rights. The sale price is 100 million won. The price was set at around 10,000 won per share by adding a management premium to 10,000 won per share in evaluating the terms and future growth of domestic and foreign clients.Namu Equity rose to become the largest shareholder of C-Motech, and CEO Kim, who committed suicide as a full-time director of C-Motech in the same year, respectively, took the lead in C-Motech management. It was also at this time that the representative of Namu Equity was changed from Jeon to Kim.According to C-Motech, Kim holds a stake in Namu Equity as of the month of the year. Some are suspicious that Kim may have a separate owner, given that he is an unknown person in the field. Currently, Namu Equity, the largest shareholder of C-Motech, has been reduced to .The acquisition method through was applied to C-Motech's acquisition of Jcom, a KOSDAQ bio company, which was completed last month. JCOM's largest shareholder was changed from Kang Yong-seok's outsider to DSP Holdings last month. DSP Holdings was established last month for mergers and acquisitions. DASPI Holdings has secured 10,000 shares and management rights of JCOM with 100 million won.C-Motech then acquired a stake in DSP Holdings for a total of 100 million won, including 100 million won participating in the paid-in capital increase and 100 million won in the number of owners. In the end, Jcomm also acquired the company by succeeding the contract between Jcomm's largest shareholder and DSP Holdings to transfer of management rights.Earlier this year, JCOM came to the forefront and attempted to acquire Samhwa Savings Bank, which was suspended. JCOM sought to acquire management rights by lending KRW 100 million to its subsidiary J&C Holdings and KRW 100 million, which is added to J&C Holdings' funds, to the largest shareholder of Samhwa Savings Bank. The funds were planned to be covered by the occurrence of convertible bonds worth 100 million won.However, as the financial authorities expressed doubts about the acquisition's ability to raise funds, the acquisition of savings banks was not approved and the acquisition of savings banks was frustrated. In other words, if the financial authorities put more weight on life-sustaining rather than drastic reorganization of insolvent savings banks, it could have led to a dizzying situation in which insolvent savings banks become aggressive coffers.High-end securities information service not accessible by the news, went to the rescue of a suicide CEO of C-Motech Korea's Mark Zuckerberg Pyo Chul-min's success and frustration The extreme choice of Kia's new ride sports car following Elan...Small and medium-sized stocks are recommended for small and medium-sized stocks today, and the winner of today's real-time competition, recommended stocks, sorted reporters, copyright holders, real-time news, money, money, and redistribution are prohibited",,,,
"Attention is focusing on whether the controversy over C-Motech's stock price manipulation by President Lee Myung Bak's nephew-in-law, raised during a parliamentary audit last year, will emerge again as CEO of C-Motech Kim Tae-sung died of suicide.During a parliamentary audit last year, Rep. Cho Young-taek and Choi Moon-soon of the Democratic Party raised suspicions that Lee Myung Bak's nephew-in-law, former son-in-law, set up a company specializing in mergers and acquisitions and took over C-motec, raising stock prices by participating in the mobile communication business.Jeon is the son-in-law of Lee's brother, Lee Sang-eun, who graduated from Sogang University's business administration and served as director of Salomon Smith Barney Securities and director of Daewoo Securities' international investigation. Namu Equity, founded by Jeon, acquired C-Motech last month, and Jeon was appointed as a full-time director of C-Motech and resigned as CEO of Namu Equity. C-Motech, which has a background of his nephew-in-law, announced its entry into the electric vehicle market last year, gave up, and began to participate in the stake in Korea Mobile Internet, but failed to secure business rights.Shares of C-Motech jumped accordingly, and in the process, controversy was raised through stock sites that Jeon made significant capital gains through the issuance of bonds with underwriting rights and that ant investors were damaged. At last, the issue was also officially mentioned in the National Assembly.Rep. Cho Young-taek pointed out in a monthly parliamentary inspection that Jeon bought hundreds of millions of won worth of C-Motech shares within months after establishing Namu Equity, a merger and acquisition company, and the source of the funds was unclear. At the time, Namu Equity said it plans to borrow 100 million won of the purchase price and raise 100 million won through capital increase.It's only been a few months since Cho was foundedExperts stressed that it is difficult to even mention the capital increase in the capital market for companies specializing in mergers and acquisitions that have no performance to do.Rep. Choi Moon-soon also claimed that as it was revealed that Jeon was the son-in-law of Lee's brother-in-law at the time, C-Motech's stock price spread, causing damage to ant investors.However, Jeon was absent due to his overseas business trip during the parliamentary inspection, and the controversy has been subdued since then.However, as CEO Kim of C-Motech committed suicide this time, questions are mounting about the cause of the suicide and the relationship between Jeon and Kim.An official at Cho's office said, ""Jeon led the acquisition of C-Motech at the time,"" but added, ""After the controversy, Jeon stepped down and Kim appeared in the front, and Kim was identified as the so-called pants manager.""Jeon resigned from Wahl's Motec last year after the controversy. However, CEO Kim is the one who appears after Namu Equity, founded by Jeon, acquired C Motec in the month of this year. Following Jeon, CEO Kim immediately became CEO of Namoi Quarty and immediately became CEO of C-Motech.According to C-Motech's announcement, CEO Kim graduated from Dongyang Industrial College and served as CEO of Innovation and CEO of Seoul Electronics through semiconductors. Kim has a stake in Namu Equity as of Monday.However, according to the industry, Kim is a completely unknown figure in the private equity industry. An industry source said, ""Jeon has experience in this field, but Kim has never heard of him in this field.""So far, no specific facts have been revealed about Kim's specific reasons for his suicide and Kim's relationship with Chun. As a result, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that Jeon's controversial Simotech case, which was re-emerged in politics in the wake of the suicide case last year.Even the CEO of the high-end securities information service, Suicide C-Motech Company, which is not accessible by the news, can't get paid by the seized C-Motech employee...Where is the capital increase?

"Dongbu Securities and Woori Investment & Securities, the securities firms in charge of the paid-in capital increase conducted two months ago by C-Motech, which is on the verge of delisting, said they did not detect any signs of rejection.In addition, in the case of general public offerings for forfeited shares, a considerable amount of the damage will be limited as they are sold in the market.C-Motech received a subscription from last month to day and carried out a paid-in capital increase worth 100 million won. It will be allocated to shareholders first, raise funds through a general public offering in the event of forfeited shares, and if it falls short, the securities firm in charge will divide it and take over.In the process of subscription for capital increase, shareholders subscribed for KRW 100 million, and KRW 100 million was allocated during the general public offering process. There is no volume taken by securities firms because all individual investors are taking care of it.C-Motech's push for the capital increase was made on the basis of a semi-annual report submitted on a monthly basis last year. There were no signs of rejection at the time. Last month, operating profit succeeded in turning into a surplus with KRW 100 million, and net profit also recorded KRW 100 million.However, in the process of promoting the capital increase, the capital increase schedule was delayed due to two requests for correction with the aim of clarifying the details of the use of the public offering amount in detail. The capital increase was mainly used to repay billions of won in loans and corporate bonds borrowed from savings banks such as Seoul Savings Bank, and the rest will be used to purchase raw materials.As the capital increase process was delayed, the results of the audit of the business report came out after the paid-in capital increase was completed, and C-Motech was on the verge of delisting due to its refusal of opinion.An official from Dongbu Securities said, ""We did not expect the accounting firm to reject the opinion of the securities firm in the process of managing the capital increase, but there was no room for the securities firm to intervene.""An official from Woori Investment & Securities explained that C-Motech was in a situation where its appearance was growing, and its operating profit turned positive, so it decided to manage the paid-in capital increase based on the judgment that it was possible to take over the balance.Damage to ordinary shareholders as well as existing shareholders is inevitable. However, many of them who bought C-Motech shares through general public offerings are expected to sell them in the short term, limiting the damage to the minimum.Of the KRW 100 million in forfeited shares acquired by ordinary investors, the amount held so far is reported to be around KRW 100 million. C-Motech's shareholders received applications from Monday to Sunday for general public offerings. While the capital increase value is the cause per share, the stock price at the time of the public offering exceeded KRW. It is explained that the day when the capital increase volume was listed was on Monday, and there were many sales aimed at short-term profits as transactions were also made at the lowest price on that day.An official from the securities firm in charge said, ""We need to consider various variables to prevent damage to investors, but unexpected variables have caused investors' concerns,"" adding, ""We will watch the situation as there is a possibility that the company will normalize through re-audit.""High-end securities information service not accessible by the news, went to the rescue of a suicide CEO of C-Motech Korea's Mark Zuckerberg Pyo Chul-min's success and frustration The extreme choice of Kia's new ride sports car following Elan...What should I do with the thin ice on the KOSDAQ?

"CEO of KOSDAQ C-Motech has left the world behind and is shocking. It is believed that he made an extreme choice as he was on the verge of being kicked out due to the refusal of an accounting firm's opinion in an extreme situation where he was seized from the company's house without paying his salary since last weekend.CEO Kim Tae-sung acquired C-Motec through Namu Equity, an investment company with a capital of 100 million won last month, and made a surplus last year after overcoming shocks such as management disputes and losses.However, according to related industries, Namu Equity, which acquired CEO Kim Tae-sung and C-Motech, is known to have raised some private loan funds since the acquisition of C-Motech. In particular, it is reported that the borrowed billion won out of the acquisition price continued to pressure CEO Kim and the company.Such undisclosed financial pressure was severe, and it attempted to resolve the financial difficulties by acquiring one more listed company JCOM last month, but it was not easy. C-Motech affiliate J-Com attempted to acquire Samwha Savings Bank this month The acquisition was canceled due to consultations with related laws and related agencies.An industry source said, ""We recently received a request from C-Motech and J-Com officials to lend us 100 million won for a month,"" but speculated that the financial difficulties may have led us to make an extreme choice.Where is the illegal capital increase and where is the possibility of creditor seizure? KCCMotech succeeded in a paid-in capital increase worth 100 million won last month. This is because expectations for Korea's mobile Internet business and others exploded. However, C-Motech failed to pay the salaries of its employees and employees, and all of the company's furniture was labeled with seizure. Where did the gift money go and the house was seized without paying the employees' salaries?According to Dongbu Securities and Woori Investment & Securities, C-Motech paid back 100 million won in short-term loans borrowed from Seoul Savings Bank and Dream Savings Bank. The KRW 100 million was scheduled to be used for private equity repayment issued at the end of last month, but it was not due yet, so the funds were not immediately released.Therefore, it is observed that the seizure of company furniture is likely to be a seizure due to separate debts.Namu Equity already borrowed KRW 100 million at the time of the acquisition of C-Motech, and it is expected that its debt increased further when it acquired J-Com last month.A former Jacob official said, ""At the time of the acquisition, Namu Equity said it had a lot of funds and would take over to promote the project,"" adding, ""If Jacob's acquisition funds were also borrowed and raised, the entire capital increase could be seized.""An official from C-Motech explained, ""Although management activities were carried out normally, the salary was suddenly not paid and the house was seized,"" adding, ""We have no details due to the shock caused by the CEO's death.""Direct rejection of opinions on limiting the scope of audit of financial statements C Motech was notified by Shinyoung Accounting Corporation on the past day of rejection of opinions on audit reports. Shinyoung Accounting Corporation, which has been auditing C-Motech for years, announced a rejection of opinions due to restrictions on the scope of audit on financial statements.Last year, C-Motech's operating profit was 100 million won, and it succeeded in turning into a surplus.

"The biggest shareholder is the problem. With this word left, the CEO of KOSDAQ company C-Motech turned his back on the world. The company is scheduled to be delisted from the KOSDAQ due to problems with its accounting audit. Attention is focusing on what management problems have led to the death of the CEO beyond the market exit.Minority shareholders who are shocked by the decision to leave are in panic. The exit of KOSDAQ companies is common, but it is unprecedented for the CEO to choose suicide. It is also questionable whether the company will be able to revive in the absence of a representative to take responsibility for the situation.When delisting, small shareholders as of last year are in danger of suffering nearly 100 million won in damages. In particular, the number of affected shareholders is expected to increase further as the company has increased by KRW 100 million since last month.Investors have questioned a series of situations at the company since last year.C-Motech attracted more than 100 million won in funds twice last year and this year, and pushed for participation in J-dong Telecom, which acquired Samhwa Savings Bank, and acquired KOSDAQ companies. It was far from manufacturing wireless communication devices, which is its main job.The company had to open its hands to individual shareholders for the new business, as its largest shareholder stake was only large. When the paid-in capital increase of tens of billions of won was carried out one after another, the Financial Supervisory Service was not just looking at it. The securities report was revised several times, but the capital increase was eventually allowed last month.However, the results were minimal. It only acquired JCOM, a KOSDAQ company, through Paper Company. All the rest failed. According to an industry official, after the failure to participate in J-Dong communication through the company, talks for overseas resource development projects were in full swing recently, but Kim's sudden death caused the situation.In the end, the company made a mistake while doing business with money from the wallets of minority shareholders, and the CEO made an extreme decision.CEO Kim, who committed suicide, hinted that the incident occurred due to the largest shareholder in the last phone call he had with a reporter on the last day. He also served as the head of Namu Equity, the largest shareholder, and held some shares, but set an angle. Namu Equity is not being identified because it is a private equity fund.The start of the problem was a report on the operation of the internal accounting management system signed by CEO Kim. As a result of the review by the accounting firm, it was found that the substance and adequacy of important fund transactions could not be confirmed due to important vulnerabilities in internal control procedures, and the internal accounting management system set by the company was not observed. It explains that there is a significant vulnerability in internal control that does not operate sufficient and appropriate control procedures in the fund management procedure. This means that there has been a big change in the company since last year as Shinyoung Accounting Corporation, which is in charge of accounting audits, is not the first to conduct an audit of C-Motech.Meanwhile, Cimotech's minority shareholders held an emergency meeting and decided to intervene in the settlement of the situation through a meeting of representative shareholders.

He blurted out the end of his words, saying, ""CEO Kim is not the one to do that.""JCOM says its parent company, C-Motech, is on the verge of delisting due to rejection of its audit opinion and the CEO took his life, but there is no problem with the business currently being pursued.An official said, ""It is not directly related to C-Motech except for the investment of the consortium to secure J-Dong's business rights,"" adding, ""The U+ and the Ministry of Public Administration and Security are conducting a pilot project to monitor ambulance accidents.""In addition, the new product launched at the Hanover Sebit Fair in Germany earlier this month was well received and is being exported to the country, and it is also exporting corona detectors to check for high-voltage wires.JCOM is a manufacturer of raw materials drugs and wireless communication devices, and became a subsidiary of C-Motech last year when Wall C-Motech acquired a stake in DAP Holdings, J-Com's largest shareholder. DAP Holdings has a stake in JCOM.JCOM turned into a deficit year-on-year with operating loss of 100 million won and net loss of 100 million won last year.

"Kim Tae-sung, CEO of KOSDAQ-listed C-Motech, who was on the verge of being kicked out due to the rejection of an audit opinion, was found to have died.Kim's cause of death was not confirmed, but he reportedly committed suicide.C-Motech currently set up a mortuary at the funeral hall of Chung-Ang University Hospital in Heukseok-dong, Seoul. According to police and company officials, CEO Kim attempted suicide the previous evening and was urgently transferred to Anyang Metro Hospital in Gyeonggi-do, but died.Police are currently investigating officials for specific causes of death.C-Motech, which was listed last month, has received attention as a promising wireless data card modem manufacturer, such as commercializing wireless modems such as login for the first time in Korea.Last year, it posted sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won, which turned into a surplus compared to the previous year.However, the accounting firm in charge recently refused to confirm the substance of the fund transaction due to the company's weak investment and fund management, which is on the verge of being kicked out.Namu Equity, which took over C-Motech's management rights last month, focused on entering new businesses and mergers and acquisitions of other companies, including the declaration of participation in the electric vehicle business and the acquisition of J-Dong Telecom, a bio company such as stem cells.The market believes that the reason for the accounting firm's refusal of opinion is that the company's actual financial status is different, which is actually due to allegations of embezzlement.Journalist Byun Kwan-yeol of Hankyung Dotcom and press release.",,,,
"The CEO's suicide shock Last year, the merger and business expansion, which were on the verge of being kicked out due to the rejection of the audit opinion despite the operating profit of billions, ended with the CEO's suicide. Kim Tae-sung, CEO of C-Motech, was found dead near his home in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province. In the car where Kim attempted suicide, a suicide note was also issued. It came two days after C-Motech received a notification from the accounting firm in charge of the past to reject the audit opinion.CEO Kim, who continued to expand the stem cells of electric vehicles, made his name known to the stock market since he founded Tree Equity, which specializes in companies, in last month. Namu Equity has signed a contract to acquire C-Motech, which commercialized wireless modems such as login for the first time in Korea in months. It was a de facto non-capital raising of KRW 100 million in management rights acquisition by borrowing and capital increase.Since then, CEO Kim has continued to expand his business. C-Motech announced its participation in the electric vehicle business last month. Namu Equity acquired JCOM, which ran a bio business such as stem cells, last month. On Monday, he announced his participation in J-Dong communication through C-Motech. Since the end of last year, it has even pushed for the acquisition of savings banks through JCOM, but it has been canceled due to lack of legal requirements.In pushing for the new project, Namu Equity continued to inject funds from outside. Analysts say that it may have spent at least 100 million won on the acquisition of Jacob. C-Motech conducted a paid-in capital increase of 100 million won this month in the name of research and development.In the meantime, President Lee Myung Bak's nephew-in-law, Jeon, served as CEO of Namu Equity and director of C-Motech, and C-Motech was classified as a theme stock. Jeon left the company last month.However, all of these attempts have failed, and C-Motech's stock price has fallen to KRW for the first time in more than a year, and trading has been trading.In the future of C-Motech, Makmak Securities believes that CEO Kim may have had no choice but to expand his business and touch the company's funds. Shinyoung Accounting Corp., which rejected the opinion, said it could not confirm the substance of the fund transaction due to the company's weak investment and fund management. An official from the securities industry analyzed that it actually means embezzlement.CEO Kim's suicide also cast a dark cloud over the future of C-Motech and J-Com, which are listed companies affiliated with Namu Equity. When the accounting firm first rejected the opinion, C-Motech said it would not be difficult to maintain the listing even if it was embezzled. This is because it made sales of 100 million won last year and made operating profit of 100 million won to turn into a surplus.The C-Motech stake in Tree Equity, which once reached... has shrunk to...

In particular, investors continue to criticize JCOM as it said that unlike its parent company C-Motech, which received a rejection of its audit opinion at a shareholders' meeting just six days ago.""It was last month that C-Motech, which is on the verge of being kicked out, said one investor on a stock-related website, ""Unlike C-Motech, there was no financial problem in the company's books,"" adding, ""The shareholders' meeting only suffered more losses."" Another investor also expressed anger, saying, ""Those who hurt good shareholders should be severely punished.""

"Can I survive?This is a lamentable question from a woman of a small minority shareholder who met at the regular shareholders' meeting of C-Motech at the Samjeong Hotel in Yeoksam-dong, Seoul, last month.C-Motech's regular shareholders' meeting was held from the morning, with the media and ordinary people except shareholders and company officials strictly controlling access to the shareholders' meeting.Even before the general meeting, minority shareholders, who filled the seats, all agreed that the delisting should be prevented. In this context, the company and minority shareholders held a shareholders' meeting after prior consultation, and the day was set up as a venue for exchange of opinions on the company's rehabilitation plan without a special agenda resolution.Perhaps that's why the shareholders' meeting, which lasted for about hours, was held in a relatively calm atmosphere, although there were occasional shouts between minority shareholders.A company official also said, ""Today, both minority shareholders and companies are here to overcome the current situation.""However, at the meeting of minority shareholders held after the official shareholders' meeting, there were constant voices of criticism against the largest shareholders and accounting firms here and there.In particular, there were high voices of criticism against the largest shareholder.Minority shareholders have raised the level of criticism, saying that Namo Equity, the largest shareholder, intentionally siphoned off company funds and drove a sound company to the brink of delisting.One shareholder expressed regret, saying, ""Does it make sense for a company that achieved 100 million won in sales based on solid technology to be delisted overnight?""In response, a company official said, ""Most of the funds have been managed by the largest shareholders, including KRW 100 million raised through paid-in capital increase last month,"" adding, ""We hope the financial authorities will investigate and reveal the true nature of the largest shareholder.""There have also been voices of criticism against Shinyoung Accounting Corp., which was in charge of auditing.An individual investor who is in charge of consulting with a minority shareholders' meeting said, ""Shinyoung accounting firm is currently out of touch and cannot meet,"" adding, ""We are trying to contact them, so please wait until work.""However, the participants raised suspicions that the accounting firm should clarify its position and only attach a letter of intent to re-audit when filing an objection to the delisting of Japan, but there are many suspicious things that cannot be contacted.In the meantime, minority shareholders said they should all work together to take over management rights, and asked for active participation from minority shareholders. A minority shareholder said, ""If there are people who are thinking about something else, they cannot be delisted and re-started the company,"" stressing that the company's wrongs can be transparently identified only by collecting stakes and acquiring management rights.Another shareholder insisted on delivering our intention to the Korea Exchange.Meanwhile, C-Motech was notified by Shinyoung Accounting Corp., an external auditor, on last month, and CEO Kim Tae-sung committed suicide two days later.Reporter Kim Ho",,,,

The general shareholders' agenda is approval of financial statements, approval of directors' audit remuneration limits.An official at C-Motech's minority shareholders' meeting said, ""We will take over management rights through a vote to demand an extraordinary shareholders' meeting before the shareholders' meeting.""Since the past, minority shareholders of C-Motech have launched minority shareholders' meetings through online and offline communities and have been delegating voting rights.Inaccessible high-end securities information service, Kakao Talk blocking news agency, super-strong, Bill Gates, who was on board, drove home because of the Lamborghini, the winner of the Japanese earthquake, scrapped the new airport, and made a quick investment",,,,

"Conservative position of the underwriter due to concerns over the actual review of the contract termination ahead of the payment of intermediate payments such as EduPass to the confirmation English company, which signed a contract to sell management rights last month. CEO Kim Sang-woo planned to hand over some of his shares and management rights to Faros Investment Korea CEO Kim Hyung-gon. However, the contract was terminated in about months. The reason is known to be the conflict over the repayment of bank loans due to the change in management.EduPass, which once heated up the KOSDAQ market with electric vehicle-related stocks. The company was also abruptly terminated recently. In fact, H Partners, which was scheduled to buy Manchuria, which was held by Kim Ki-soo, the largest shareholder, for billions of won, did not pay the balance. The company announced on the last day that the change of the largest shareholder has been canceled.The KOSDAQ market is unusual. Although the number of corporate sales has not decreased, there are a growing number of cases of termination after signing the contract, as in the case of Edupass, a confirmed English company.According to the industry and the Financial Supervisory Service's electronic disclosure, there have been a series of cases in which sales contracts have been terminated in the KOSDAQ market. In addition to confirmation English companies and EduPass, the merger contract of Testec with Testec, which signed a sale contract between PS&G and Ubiquitous, has been canceled only recently.For now, Ubiquitous was canceled because the buyer did not pay the balance like EduPass. An official from the company explained that Phoenix Digital Tech, the largest shareholder, offered its stake and management rights, but it was canceled because it did not deposit KRW 100 million in the buyer, KC PM&H.PS&G announced in a correction announcement on the last month that the contract for the acquisition of stocks and management rights with Convex has been terminated. The merger contract was terminated as the merger contract was not approved at the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting.Convex, a control measurement robot company, was planning to acquire and merge PAS&G at the same time. However, due to the rejection of the merger plan, contracts to acquire the merger contract were canceled one after another.Prior to this, the merger contract between Testec and Shin Sung Tech was terminated. The contract has nothing to do with changes in management rights, but the merger was canceled due to major creditors of Shin Sung-tech's side expressing opposition.Usually, the cancellation of the sale contract occurs a lot when the buyer fails to draw the scheduled funds. Acquisitors who want to buy KOSDAQ companies are often attracting financial investors like those who acquire large companies, but there have been occasional cases of termination due to this difficulty.However, it is analyzed that the recent termination of the merger contract is more fundamental than this. Stock industry sources explain that the recent cancellation of sales and merger contracts means that investor sentiment has frozen.In particular, it is rumored that the Korea Exchange's policy to review the delisting had a great influence on officials.It is explained that even listed companies that paid billions of billions of won and acquired them are being delisted if they are caught up in embezzlement or accounting fraud.An official from an over-the-counter company who recently stepped down from acquiring a listed company said, ""We have no choice but to carefully check the fate of the company because of a moment's mistake,"" adding, ""That's why there are many cases where we don't deposit intermediate payments.""The official also said, ""Of course, it is difficult to conclude that KOSDAQ companies are insolvent because the merger contract has been terminated,"" adding, ""It is true that the case of Neo Semitech has greatly shocked market officials and this has increased the sense of crisis.""An official from a securities firm's corporate finance team said, ""Wall is a holiday season, but corporate sales are not small,"" adding, ""However, there seem to be many buyers who take a conservative stance due to concerns over the actual review of the Korea Exchange.""As merger contracts are terminated one after another, voices of concern about damage to individual investors are increasing.A small shareholder of a confirmed English company expected to turn into a new company, but instead, the image of a insolvent company has accumulated,"" he said, pointing out that both sides are responsible for minimizing losses of small shareholders while carefully.The Korea Exchange is expressing expectations that the market will be as healthy as the atmosphere spreads further. An official of the Korea Exchange predicted that if the actual screening reduces the number of insolvent companies, the market will be centered on blue-chip companies.

As EduPass, which acquired monthly management rights last year, entered the electric vehicle battery charger market, stock prices are moving as it belongs to electric vehicle theme stocks.In particular, there are also expectations for SCD, a motor company, to enter the electric vehicle market.However, Actuo plans to focus on improving its performance through Korea OBI Daeyoung Steel, an unlisted company that merged with its main business last year, rather than benefiting from its subsidiary's electric vehicle theme. President Park Sung-hoon said in a telephone interview with the Japanese Herald Economy, ""Although there was a transition period, the performance will improve in earnest from this year,"" adding, ""For example, soundproofing fences using Korea OB can make sales.""President Park also explained that Enterpia's nanofiber technology is accelerating research and development for mass production with already commercialized technology.Some minority shareholders raised the issue of Antipia's method of reduction and said they would respond at the general shareholders' meeting this month by gathering power of attorney. However, the possibility of a change in the atmosphere due to the recent rise in stock prices and the acquisition of NVIX cannot be ruled out. In response, President Park said, ""I understand that Entopia will announce its position again soon.""Reporter Lee Tae-kyung, Roh Hong-chul, Jang Yoon-jung, Shinbo Manjang, Sales of Good Friends Moon Geun-young, Hepatitis drama, Superstar Hot, Announcer Yoo Young-mi, Second Youth Publishing Herald Live News Herald Economy, No Reproduction or Redistribution",,,,

"Investors are confused by the sudden downward revision of the earnings outlook presented by large KOSDAQ market listed companies with the highest market capitalization in the first half. In particular, some listed companies are suspected of inflating their earnings forecasts to raise their stock prices by halving their net profit forecasts for sales and operating profit compared to the first half.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Financial Supervisory Service, SVH, Neofidelity, Seoul Semiconductor, POSCO Comtus Neowiz Games and others are listed companies that changed their earnings forecasts in the second half of this year. Among them, except for Neowiz Games, which raised its forecast for sales and operating profit by one notch, lowered its earnings forecast for this year.Excluding SVH and Neofidelity, Seoul Semiconductor and POSCO Comtus are the top companies in the market capitalization.In the correction announcement, POSCO lowered its earnings forecast from 100 million won to 100 million won in sales and 100 million won in operating profit from 100 million won to 100 million won in operating profit. Net profit fell to KRW 100 million, which is the level of KRW 100 million in forecast or forecast disclosure of sales and operating profit in the first half.Seoul Semiconductor lowered its operating profit forecast by 100 million won to 100 million won last month due to a decrease in margins due to a contraction in short-term demand for forward industries. This year's sales forecast was kept at 100 million won.SVH lowered its sales forecast for this year from 100 million won to 100 million won. Operating profit changed from a surplus of 100 million won to a deficit of 100 million won. Neofidelity changed its forecast sales for this year from 100 million won to 100 million won in its forecast or forecast correction on sales and operating profit and loss on last month. Operating profit is less than half of the first half of the forecast.Oh Kyung-taek, head of Small Cap at Dongyang Financial Securities, advised that KOSDAQ companies should check whether they are pursuing new businesses rather than blindly trusting their earnings forecasts at the beginning of the year, saying, ""According to the situation of the business and suppliers.""Ahn Hyun-duk, a copyright holder, Financial News.

"Investors are confused by the half-baked earnings forecast announced by listed KOSDAQ market companies.This is because cumulative sales and operating profit net income until the quarter are significantly different from the pink outlook announced earlier this year by listed companies.One of the companies' performance inflation date Financial News surveyed the opening of a listed company with monthly settlements, which announced its outlook or forecast on sales and operating profit from this year to this month, showing a difference in actual performance from the company's forecast earlier this year.Lutronic's annual forecast sales in its forecast or forecast disclosure on sales, operating profit, etc. last month were 100 million won, but cumulative sales until the quarter were only 10 million won. Operating profit and net profit for the current term were also KRW 100 million until the month of this year, far short of the estimated amount of KRW 100 million and KRW 100 million that was proposed earlier this year.AJS announced on Monday that it will achieve sales of 100 million won this year. On the other hand, cumulative sales in the quarter barely reached more than 100 million won.Neowiz Internet said in a forecast or forecast announcement on sales and operating profit and loss on last month that it expects sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won this year. But the result is the opposite. Although its quarterly sales reached some 100 million won, its cumulative operating profit was 100 million won, which fell far short of its forecast at the beginning of the year.EastSoft and WinFonet Internet summit JLS Shinseong Delta Tech Free Tour are also below the forecast suggested earlier this year.After comparing actual performance and forecast, Investment & Fire Technology lowered its sales forecast for this year from 100 million won to 100 million won in the previous day's correction. The operating profit estimate was lowered from 100 million won to 100 million won. EcoPro lowered its sales estimate from 100 million won to 100 million won. It also lowered its operating profit and net profit forecast from 100 million won to 100 million won, respectively.SVH Neofidelity, Seoul Semiconductor and Com2us also lowered their sales and operating profit for the second half of the year.The Korea Exchange recommends each listed company to disclose corrections if there is a large gap between the net profit forecast of listed companies' sales and operating profit and actual performance. The intention is to prevent confusion among investors due to the wide gap between the forecast presented by listed companies and their performance. However, if the listed company does not correct the outlook or prediction of sales and operating profit or loss by correcting the correction, it will be designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation.An official of the Korea Exchange insisted on a pink outlook until the end, saying that listed companies that offered pink forecasts at the beginning of the year but belatedly corrected them are better There are listed companies designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations, so investors advised that it is desirable to invest by comparing actual performance and estimates.Ahn Hyun-duk, a copyright holder, Financial News.

"A cold wave hit the KOSDAQ market. As a result of external audits of semi-annual reports of KOSDAQ-listed corporations, a number of companies have been found to be inappropriate. In particular, investors who invested in companies that were judged inappropriate are also expected to suffer considerable damage.According to the Korea Exchange and the Financial Supervisory Service's fair disclosure, the number of companies that were judged to be limited to rejection of opinions reached the results of an external audit of KOSDAQ-listed companies. In addition, listed companies that did not submit semi-annual audit reports, such as Dahwi Di Chocolate Histem and VSST Test, have also been changed.As a result of the half-year audit, new companies such as MNC Aroma Soft Neosemitech HanWireless True Hour ENTec Nature Global Taekwang NC were rejected, followed by G&E SVH and others with limited opinions on the grounds of restrictions on the scope of audit.Taekwang ENC, which had been seeking a comeback by turning into a green company such as electric vehicles, was rejected by Samil Accounting Corp. Samil Accounting Corp. cited Taekwang N.C. as a reason for the possibility of contingent liabilities due to the completion of real debt to the company's loans and treasury stocks.Nature Global, which was planning to enter the bottled water market in the second half of the year by resolving various legal disputes, was also rejected. Sangnok Accounting Corp., which was in charge of the audit, cited a confirmation of non-issuance of shares in Lahenne Resort, an investment stock in real terms of cash tense of KRW 100 million, as reasons for the rejection.In addition, SVH and G&E, which were limited to audit opinions, were notified that they were not provided with sufficient financial information to review the reality of assets among KRW 100 million in cashable assets in the statement of financial position, respectively.Among the companies that received rejection of audit opinions, some companies that received rejection of opinions as a result of last warm audit were included.

STC Life, a stem cell cosmetics seller, was included in the screening list due to massive losses of more than equity capital.World Tour, a travel agency, and Hallym Startup Investment, an overseas resource development company, were designated as corporations that are feared to be delisted because they did not submit a semi-annual report while being designated as a management item beyond the capital erosion rate.

"It is operated by STC Life in the procedure using fat stem cells and platelet anterior plasma. The hospital said it successfully treated patients with knee arthritis.The knee joint is the area where local degenerative changes occur the fastest as the cartilage of the joint wears off, and arthritis was considered simply a degenerative disease due to aging in the past, but in reality, it is known that symptoms differ due to various factors such as age, gender, genetic and obesity. In the case of Hong Kong-born Mamo, who suffers from knee arthritis under treatment at the hospital's stem cell treatment center, abdominal fat and blood were collected, separated fat stem cells and platelet-rich plasma, mixed, and injected into both knee joints of the patient. The patient's pain after the day of the procedure has decreased abnormally, and it is known that the pain does not appear after weeks of completion of the procedure.Based on these results, the hospital will actively apply a mixed procedure method with fat stem cells to the treatment of knee arthritis.Meanwhile, STC Life is conducting genetic research and stem cell therapy related to the development of new drugs such as next-generation anticancer drugs and dementia treatments and control of active oxygen in the body.

"At the same time, he was on the verge of being kicked out as he was examined whether he was subject to a substantial review of delisting Stock prices of Bokwang TES and Green Snake Media, which have been revived, are mixed. Bogwang TES and Green Snakes were on the verge of delisting as their quarterly sales fell short of 100 million won.As of 1 a.m., Bogwang TS, which sells electronic components in the KOSDAQ market, is trading at the won, a sharp drop from the previous day. The suspension of trading was lifted as it was confirmed that the reason for less than KRW 100 million in sales in the recent quarter was resolved, but investor sentiment remains frozen.Shares of Green Snake, a sitcom maker that eliminated less than 100 million won in sales in the first quarter, a day later than Bogwang T.S., surged. Green snakes are trading at the upper limit as they were traded at the won-up from the previous day on the first day of trading again.Bogwang TES and Green Snake's stock prices are showing such mixed moves because investors are giving different scores to the management stability of the two companies.In the case of Bogwang TS, although the transaction has resumed, it has been designated as an investor's ventilation item because of the risk of insolvency from the Korea Exchange. Investors are reluctant to buy stocks because companies designated as investors' ventilation stocks are more likely to be withdrawn than other companies.On the other hand, Green Snakes are benefiting from the overall boom in the media entertainment industry. Recently, media entertainment-related stocks have been showing strong stock prices as investors' attention has been focused on the content business along with improved performance.Meanwhile, STC Life, a stem cell cosmetics seller, is still suspended from trading.

"On the expiration date of submission of the first-half report, there were a series of restrictions on audit opinions or refusal of opinions on KOSDAQ-listed companies.Eugene Data was rejected as the highest warning in the audit report, adding to the reason for designating a management item. In addition, Pyeongsan and ESC Life, a big match, were limited in their opinions.YU JIN's data is rejected.Daeguk Pyeongsan STC's opinion limited to Eugene Data was rejected by the accounting firm on the same day. This is because it is impossible to predict whether or not to win the ongoing KRW 100 million check claim lawsuit will have a significant impact on the financial statements.The company also said that the capital erosion rate reached .100 million won and the total capital was .100 million won.Denial of opinion is a higher level of warning than the limit. In the case of restrictions, there are important defects in the financial statements, but if they are sufficiently considered and corrected, it is the same as the appropriate opinion. However, rejection of an opinion is made if it is impossible to express an opinion or if the entity's continuity is objectively very unclear.In the case of refusal of the audit opinion, it is considered that the requirement for delisting occurs, and the transaction is immediately suspendedLarge countries that have been designated as management items due to capital erosion have been limited to audit opinions. Pyeongsan also failed to provide data for the review of asset damage on tangible assets and received limited audit opinions from accounting firms.STC Life was limited due to omission of commentary on uncertainties related to corporate households. As capital erosion has reached, it is inevitable that the reasons for the review of the substance of mutual loss will occur.The limitation of audit opinions does not immediately lead to reasons for delisting. However, restrictions often lead to rejection of opinions. However, if the reason for the limited occurrence is resolved by the deadline for submitting the next audit report, it may be avoided. A series of reports of abnormal capital erosion also reported a series of cases in which reasons for designating management items beyond capital erosion have occurred due to the expiration of the report.G&D Wintec announced that despite receiving the audit opinion, there was a reason for designating a management item beyond capital erosion.

Point Eye said that the capital erosion rate was . last year, which caused the designation of management items, but the reason was resolved by lowering it to . in the first half of this year.Reports for the first half of the year can be received until midnight on that day.A source at the exchange said, ""It is rare for a report to be submitted until the deadline is imminent, so we usually submit the report by the time limit. However, in the previous half of the year, the report was submitted beyond the evening time.""As of this time, pharmaceutical companies subject to KOSDAQ have submitted audit reports.Meanwhile, China's Goseom, which drew attention to the expiration date of the report, announced on the same day that it had received final approval from the Singapore stock market to extend the regular shareholders' meeting to this month.

"Investors are increasingly anxious about related stocks as the current stock price is higher than the issuance price, which is likely to profit-taking, and the exercise of the rights of stock-type bonds such as bonds with new equity rights and convertible bonds is pouring in. In general, the current stock price is expected to far exceed the issuance price, leading to profit-taking. It is also feared that companies that have made large capital increases will be put up for sale along with dilution of stock values one after another.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, the place where additional listing of stocks is just around the corner due to the exercise of the rights of stock-type bonds, and the current stock prices of the companies are far above the exercise price.In the case of Woori Technology, where Manchuria is listed on the stock market due to the upcoming exercise of Ilshin stock ownership, the current stock price is more than twice as high as the exercise price of Won. Blue Gem D&C's current stock price, which will be newly listed on the same day due to the exercise of its rights, is more than the exercise price in won. The current stock prices of MLSI and Osung ST, which are scheduled to be listed as new shares in the coming days due to the exercise of rights, are also 10,000 won, more than the exercise price.In addition, D-Technology and Semitech BioSmart are laughing at the exercise price of their rights.Some stocks are feared to be pressured by the exercise of the stock conversion rights of convertible bonds. The current stock price of ESC Life and Efuture S-Poletech, which are set to be listed as new shares in the coming days due to the convertible bond event, is higher than the exercise price.A KOSDAQ market spokesperson said, ""Investors should check the current stock price and exercise price of the stock first when new stocks or convertible bonds are exercised,"" adding, ""If the stock price exceeds the exercise price, most of the stock prices are likely to fall sharply.""In addition, ST Cube and Dongbu Robot MB Seongsan are raising concerns about the volume release by conducting a large-scale paid-in capital increase worth 100 million won. This is because if the issuance price is far below the current stock price, there is no protection deposit period prohibited from selling, so investors can immediately start profit-taking after the stock is listed on a set date.An official from the securities industry said, ""The issuance price is significantly lower than the current stock price because most of the large capital increase is applied,"" adding, ""It doesn't matter if the exercise price exceeds the current stock price, but in the opposite case, we should consider the possibility of selling it in the market.""Investors' anxiety over related stocks is growing as the rights of stock-type bonds such as bonds with underwriting rights and convertible bonds are pouring in.

"For people, stocks are a means of finance that starts with a small amount of money and makes a lot of money. And even at this time, new people are gathering to succeed in stock investment. However, people already knew even before they started the stock market that only a few people succeeded in the stock market.As only a few succeed, there are many investors who fail, and unfortunately, most of the investors who fail are investing in stocks for the purpose of recovering their principal.Even at this time, many people are trying their best to recover their principal, and you can see how many individual investors are trying to recover their principal by looking at the actual super ant-run portal site integrated stock cafe membership cafe.This cafe is a cafe with more than tens of thousands of members and is now a popular spot in the stock market with many individual investors joining. Mr. Lee, who runs this cafe, was introduced as a myth of billion success in most broadcasting and media, and became a hot topic.His success story is still legendary in the stock market, and his record of being the youngest analyst ever to be selected as the best expert in a short period of time after his success as a super ant is still unbroken.But he, who succeeded too early, has been skeptical about his analyst life and has since last year opened a securities cafe in Daum and Naver to help individual investors struggling with losses, recommending real-time events to people every day for free.The cafe, which first started as a club, is rumored to have a high hit and high return on free recommendations and many people recover their principal with free recommendations, and more than 10,000 members of Daum Cafe are still joining.His cafe bulletin board, which has become a hot spot for people who find him and now invest in stocks, has been flooded with praise, including a message that he bought a house thanks to his monthly profit of more than 1,000 won. Of course, if you look at this part alone, you can see a pleasant sight in the desolate stock market for the first time in a long time.However, no matter how many super ants recommend free sports, people gather, but the fact that more than one person a day joins every day means that there are many individual investors who are desperate, and the reality is that there are still many people who suffer from losses.Cafes are more inconvenient than sites, and just by looking at cafes, which are not even sites, becoming so famous, you can see how many investors struggle to make a profit.Even now, in order to help individual investors recover their principal every day, he/she recommends stocks for free at his/her cafe, known more as a billion-stock cafe than by its name, and finally said this.With the spread of the Internet, stock investment has been activated enough to be selected as the top of the financial technology rankings, but there is still a lack of services, and I started a free recommendation sport because I am sorry for this, and I am proud to thank so many people and will work harder in the future.Industry-specific analysis of the market: Space aviation, defense beverage, life insurance, shipping company, Big Tech, Trec, iKooksundang, Muhak R&L, Sammi, Thanol, Pungguk, Dongyang Life, Samsung, Hyundai, Sunheung, Ah, Shipping, Korea, Nocells, Bridge, S.Pam, Biosebals, Blue Net, Samsung ElectronicsKwon Dong Yang Securities Woori Investment & Securities Dongbu Securities Kyobo Securities Daewoo Securities Kiwoom Securities Semiconductor and Semiconductor Equipment Enspurun Electronic Mtech Vision QSI&C ITC Semiconductor Auditech Shimtek Comico DongALDEX OSST Telechips Shinseong F.A.C.E.G.Woo Techron.Borge IMTec.G.G.G.G.G.S.

As a result, Huawei Tech has been in the red since last year.

"The four Korea Exchange, which appeared in the studio of Kim Joo-young, a reporter for Money Today Broadcasting's Ministry of Economy and Securities, reorganized the KOSDAQ market's affiliated system on the last day and designated investor stocks. We would like to talk about what criteria the companies designated and what their positions are.Question When you say investment stocks, it literally means to be careful when investing. It means that the market is blacklisted and traded, but why did you introduce it? Yes, it was not easy for investors to notice the risk before it was designated as a management item or the reason for delisting occurred.The exchange said it has designated investor ventilation stocks so that investors can make careful investments on their own in advance.Question What companies have been designated as investment-oriented ventilation items? Investor-oriented ventilation items The exchange has designated corporate changes that are considered to have problems with corporate continuity and management transparency.There's a back.Originally, it was a dog event when I gave research service last year. As the condition of companies improved a lot in the financial statements for the business year, the number of stocks decreased.Questions. I don't think the stock price of these stocks was intact. It is no exaggeration to say that the stock price has fallen sharply since it was designated to pay attention to investment yesterday and today after the date was designated.Among the dog stocks, the price limit has fallen.In addition, individual stocks such as International DY, IDN, Ace, Hi-Tech, and Accuris reached an abnormal rate of decline rate of decline. The average rate of decline in individual stocks reached .Did any companies get a question? While individual stocks were shunned by investors, there were also some stocks that rose. Blue Gem D&C Matching Elsys went up.The exchange said that it is not convinced that the stock price has risen, although the designation as an investor's ventilation item requires attention to the continuity of the company and transparency of the company.Question What happens if these stocks continue to fall, but if they are designated as investor stocks, they will be subject to a real review of delisting if management changes occur or capital increase has been withdrawn to capital increase participants within months.Question It seems that damage to companies designated as investment stocks will be inevitable. I think there will be a lot of complaints from investors as well as the company concerned. Yes, most companies designated as investor ventilation items say their phones are not working. This is because there are a lot of protest calls from investors.The same goes for the exchange. The exchange said there may be resistance from companies, but it explains both the background and the reason why it was designated like that.I think we need to look at the criteria for how investment stocks were selected The exchange said it provided services to researchers such as statisticians and mathematicians to create an extraction model and designated the item based on the figures from the extraction model.The designation criteria largely considered quantitative and qualitative variables.First of all, the company was designated in consideration of qualitative variables such as market capitalization, debt ratio, profitability ratio, capital erosion, etc. and violation of disclosure, CEO change, bill falsification, accounting standard, embezzlement, and breach of trust.Most of the companies designated as investor ventilation stocks were deficit companies, which were vulnerable to profitability, and some were designated as factors such as changing the CEO of the disclosure.It seems that the measure was made to alert investors to be careful of these companies and to alert listed companies. If selected as the stock, the impact is expected to expand further as there is a high possibility that it will be subject to delisting review.High-end securities information service that is not accessible through news.

"The merger with Hwaseong Biopharm, a subsidiary promoted by Gyeongnam Pharmaceutical, was rejected at the shareholders' meeting.According to Gyeongsangnam-do Pharmaceutical, the agenda to approve the merger contract with its subsidiary Hwaseong Biopharm at a shareholders' meeting held at Gyeonggi Techno Park in Ansan, Gyeonggi-do, was not passed because it did not get more approval from the shareholders. The case of changing the articles of association to change the location of the headquarters was also rejected.Gyeongnam Pharmaceutical explained that although the approval of the merger contract was rejected, additional shares of subsidiaries were acquired after the initial merger contract was signed, and the small merger schedule will be resumed in consultation with related agencies.Earlier on the last day, Gyeongnam Pharmaceutical acquired additional shares of Hwaseong Biopharm as it was selected as a successful bidder for the public sale of Hwaseong Biopharm shares after L&Pias, a major shareholder of Hwaseong Biopharm, provided them as collateral to Asam Investment Advisory.Currently, Gyeongnam Pharmaceutical holds 10,000 shares of its subsidiary Hwaseong Biopharm, so if the merger proceeds, the number of new shares issued due to the merger is less than the total number of issued shares, meeting the requirements for small-scale merger.An official from Kyungnam Pharm said, ""The acquisition of additional shares in the subsidiary will significantly reduce the number of new shares in the merger, which will have a limited impact on the dilution of shares, but we expect it to be a positive factor for the stock price.""On the other hand, Gyeongnam Pharmaceutical has announced that it will not issue new shares for its subsidiaries, and small-scale mergers can replace the approval of the merger contract with a resolution of the board of directors, not a general shareholders' meeting, and the right to claim stocks is not recognized.

"The Korea Exchange will strengthen disclosure regulations for overseas resource development stocks. The Japan-Korea Exchange said it will strengthen disclosure related to resource development theme stocks as investor damage has occurred frequently due to false information related to overseas resource development.According to the Korea Exchange, one company that has disclosed resource development has been delisted or designated as a marginal company since the year.

"The faces of the companies have been mixed for a month since the Korea Exchange, a reporter for Seoul Newsis Lee In-joon, designated an investor's ventilation item. This is because only some stocks are on the rise while most companies' stock prices have been on the decline.Initially, the Korea Exchange aimed to guarantee the safety of investors by providing information on insolvent companies to the market, but some point out that it is a stigma that encourages companies in need in the market.Investors' ventilation is a system to designate companies that lack continuity and management transparency based on the previous year's settlement data every month and inform investors.If it is designated as a ventilation item for investors, it may be delisted if the actual management authority is changed to another person due to the change of the largest shareholder and the signing of a management transfer contract. In addition, stocks must be protected for months after the allocation of students' paid-in capital increase, and if they do not comply with it and repay the funds to the buyer of new shares, they may face a substantial review of delisting.Shares of individual companies designated as investor-ventilated stocks fell on average over the month, according to the monthly report card exchange. In particular, the brokerage stocks fell below the KOSDAQ average.L&Pias fell from a month ago to a month ago. Since Nextech was also designated as a ventilation item, its stock price, which used to be won, fell to won, and GIA Blue Stem Science Terraum also fell.On the other hand, some companies saw their stock prices soar. Blue Gem D&C has been designated as a ventilation event, but it has more than doubled from won to won in a month. SAT DWorks Global Hubyron also showed an upward trend at a time when the KOSDAQ market is showing adjustment.Companies that were designated as ventilation stocks were hasty or excessive regulations on the exchange, but they are saying that they were hasty while agreeing with the purpose.An official of a manufacturer designated as a ventilation event said, ""After the exchange announced that it would implement the ventilation system, it only provided guidelines and did not give details,"" adding, ""We didn't even expect it to be designated as a ventilation event.""An official from another company that manufactures electronic components said, ""Over the past month, the work has been paralyzed due to complaints from investors,"" adding, ""I don't think we've considered the damage of existing investors.""He also complained, saying, ""Once it is decided, it is impossible to get rid of the stigma of annual ventilation, but it is a problem to judge the current corporate situation based on past indicators.""The same is true of companies whose stock prices have soared. The sudden rise in stock prices has even prompted financial authorities to disclose inquiries, but they seem to have no idea.An official in charge of the company said, ""At the beginning of the designation of the ventilation item, it fell a little, but at some point, there were no special favorable articles, but suddenly it started to rise,"" adding, ""I was worried about falling stock prices, but I was embarrassed.""In response, the exchange believes that the ventilation stock system only informs the market of corporate insolvency and is not excessive regulation.An exchange official said, ""Ventilation stocks are virtually the same as management stocks,"" adding, ""Even if they do not operate normally, they are not well known to the market until they are designated as management stocks.""Meanwhile, companies designated as ventilation stocks faced a crisis of being kicked out of the market one after another. Nextech applied to the Daegu District Court on the last month for the commencement of rehabilitation procedures. Erum G&G will hold a shareholders' meeting this month to discuss the dismissal of Vice President Lee Jung-hyun, who will undergo a substantial review of delisting due to a violation of the stock management transfer contract.

UNITECH Electronics became a major shareholder after acquiring a stake in Ahn Jong-yeol, CEO of JoongAng Enlux.Unitech Electronics said it is working on a plan to recover the investment amount.

Low-pollution engine remodeling company LoomG&G will start a paid-in capital increase again after months of disposing of its own shares for financing.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Erumqien will hold a general public offering in Manchuria. At the time of the resolution of the board of directors, the expected recruitment price is about KRW 100 million based on this. The fixed recruitment price will be decided on the coming day.Erum G&G had already raised about 100 million won in funds through a general public offering of its own shares last month. Since then, it has secured about 100 million won in funds by issuing general public offerings and convertible bonds twice. Most of the funds were spent on operating expenses, purchasing raw materials, and repaying loans.The capital increase will also be spent on operating expenses for repayment of loans. As management performance is sluggish, even operating costs are entirely dependent on external procurement funds.In addition, although it is trying to improve its financial structure through repayment of loans, it has not had much effect due to its high debt ratio and lack of support for sales.

Although it generated sales of 100 million won in the first half of last year, it was reduced to 100 million won in the first half of this year.Operating profit, which recorded a deficit since last year, has continued to expand the deficit. It recorded a deficit of 100 million won in the first half of last year.This deficit structure is likely to continue until new products are released next year. This is because the market share of Loom Engine has shrunk significantly from the beginning of the business as the number of engine remodeling companies increases and competition intensifies.An official of Erum Engine said, ""With more engine remodeling companies increasing to dogs, market share has decreased and price reduction pressure has increased, so sales will be positive as we are expected to enter the emission reduction system business next year.""

The debt-to-equity ratio for this quarter amounts to .In the end, Eureum G&G started to dispose of its own shares to secure funds.

"Following the disposal of 10,000 shares, the sale price, which is expected to be less than KRW per share in the general public offering in Manchuria, is drawing attention to the loss of treasury stock disposal as low-pollution engine remodeling company LoomGENG has started to dispose of its shares one after another to raise funds.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, Erumqien will hold a general public offering on its own shares next month.This article was shipped to E-Daily Market Point, a real-time financial and economic news terminal, at 1 a.m. Use E-Daily Market Point to preview E-Daily's high-end articles.The sales price per share is scheduled to be fixed on the month and the estimated price is KRW. If the sales are completed without falling short of the estimated price, it will raise 100 million won.The sale of its own shares of Eum G&G has continued since last year.

The price per share is one won. This means that if it is disposed of below the won, it will suffer a loss of treasury stock disposal.On the other hand, the expected price of the public offering is KRW, and the stock price of Yurum G&G is also forming a market price between the wons.Losses on disposal of equity shares have no effect on net income. However, when disposed of below the acquisition price, the total capital will be reduced by the difference compared to when sold at the acquisition price.Meanwhile, Erumm G&G plans to use the public offering funds for its own shares and the repayment of loans from mutual savings banks as raw materials for low-pollution engine conversion projects and mixed truck conversion projects.

Park Dong-hoon, head of overseas sales team at TS Power, a small power generator company in Hakun-ri, Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province, is encouraged these days. Park said, ""There is little boom in this industry because once the generator is installed, it is semi-permanent,"" adding, ""The domestic construction industry is not so good these days, so I had a lot of worries, but thanks to Japan, I survived."" TS Power expects annual sales from last year's billion won to easily exceed 100 million won this year due to heavy work, including supplying diesel engine generators to Hoya, Japan's largest photomask manufacturer, at the end of last month.Domestic emergency power generation companies are enjoying a lot of Japanese specialties. As Japan is on electricity alert due to the nuclear accident, demand for power generators in Korea is soaring. Although there are many global generator manufacturers in Japan, it is known that production is being disrupted due to poor supply and demand of parts.As small and medium-sized power generation companies entered the entrance of the Namdong Industrial Complex in Incheon, where small and medium-sized power generation companies are concentrated, people dressed neatly were occasionally spotted. Yoon Hee-taek, head of the economic policy team at the Incheon Chamber of Commerce, said, ""Japanese buyers are flocking to the Namdong Industrial Complex and other Incheon manufacturing complexes these days.""The most popular item for Japanese buyers in the Namdong Industrial Complex is emergency power generators. A company official in the southeastern industrial complex said, ""There are a lot of inquiries about buying it even if it is used."" Kim Hong-soo, president of Buhyeon Electric Co., a company specializing in installing electrical equipment for buildings, said, ""Small generator assemblies at Namdong Industrial Complex are Japanese buyers who give more money, so Korean companies cannot find generators."" It is known that there are cases where you can't get it even if you wait for months.This phenomenon is like a welcome rain of drought for small and medium-sized power generation manufacturers that have been stagnant. ""Gyupi Mayonnaise, a Japanese food company that has transferred technology to Ottogi, bought an emergency generator,"" said team leader Park, adding, ""What's more encouraging is that the contract for export of power generators will be signed by the end of this month due to a lot of inquiries.""Wind power generator manufacturer Yurum Zien also signed a contract with Japan's Ikono to supply turbo wind power generators last day. A company official said, ""We will introduce wind power generators and use them for charging streetlights and electric vehicles in Tokyo,"" adding, ""This contract is only an initial supply contract and the two companies are discussing supplying the minimum and maximum generators at a general meeting over the next month.""Other power generation manufacturers located in the southeastern industrial complex are also busy with flooding orders day after day. An official from the Namdong Industrial Complex said, ""It is believed that the amount of orders received by power generators in the industrial complex has doubled compared to the month,"" adding, ""More than anything, there are many calls asking if mass supply is possible.""With this opportunity, Japanese buyers are paying attention to Korean emergency generators because they are cheap and can procure them quickly. Lee Soon-no, head of Gyeongin headquarters of the Korea Industrial Complex Corporation, predicted that orders will increase steadily over the next few years, saying, ""Domestic generators are highly preferred because they take a short time to supply."" Last month, the Japanese government urgently imported old generators from Thailand as electricity shortages worsened.Seo Kang-seok, head of the key manufacturing industry team, said, ""We will hold a power equipment exhibition at COEX this month, which is unusual for large Japanese power companies to ask questions."" Kansai Electric Power, Chugoku Electric Power, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and others will participate in the export consultation.As the volume of Japanese power generators increased, the Korea Electricity Industry Promotion Association launched a generator consultative body in the afternoon involving generators such as Hyosung and Hyundai Heavy Industries. It is aimed at understanding and sharing market information and predicting demand for local generators in Japan among domestic companies and discussing difficulties of exporters. It is also considering sending an export promotion team to Japan by the end of this month.Reporter Park Donghwi and Haheon.

"Dong-A Pharmaceutical recently competed with its relative, Jacob, to acquire the shares. The photo shows Kang Shin-ho, chairman of Dong-A Pharmaceutical.The pharmaceutical industry's undisputed Dong-A Pharmaceutical Co., a stem cell technology and cell therapy company, has been embroiled in rumors of conflict ahead of the monthly shareholders' meeting. For your information, J-Com co-CEO Kang Yong-seok and Dong-A Pharmaceutical Vice President Kang Jung-seok are in the village.The recent acquisition of shares in each other has triggered rumors of conflict. On Monday last year, JCOM announced that Vita C Farm, a subsidiary that Chairman Park Young-sook and his son Kang Yong-seok, borrowed KRW 100 million, jointly bought about a stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical.Dong-A Pharmaceutical immediately responded by buying a stake in JCOM off-site on Monday. Dong-A Pharmaceutical bought a stake in JCOM in Manchuria through an over-the-counter purchase in Manchuria. On the same day, senior trade acquired JCOM's stake in Manju. Senior trade is a liquor company with Kang Moon-seok, the second brother of Dong-A Pharmaceutical Vice President Kang Jung-seok, former director of Dong-A Pharmaceutical, as its largest shareholder, and is an affiliate of Dong-A Socio Group. Dong-A Socio Group has secured a stake in JCOM.Some analyzed that the two companies are causing friction over the acquisition of shares between the two sides. For now, the amount of shares secured by each other is significant. The stake held by CEO Kang Yong-seok, the largest shareholder of Jacob, is... Dong-A Pharmaceutical's latest acquisition is a level that could threaten the stakes of its largest shareholders and a larger stake than Chairman Park Young-sook's.The same is true of Dong-A Pharmaceutical's stake secured by JCOM. Currently, Kang Shin-ho, chairman of Dong-A Pharmaceutical, has secured a stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical. The figure is close to Chairman Kang's stake that JCOM bought this time. In addition, all shares held by related parties other than Chairman Kang Shin-ho are... JCOM's stake is far short of this, but the situation is different considering that Hanmi Pharmaceutical, a major shareholder, holds a stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical. This is because JCOM and Hanmi Pharmaceutical have a stake that can change their largest shareholders in solidarity.In fact, looking at the recent moves of the two companies, this interpretation is not unreasonable. JCOM, which exclusively supplied taurine and tuberculosis treatments, which are the raw materials for Bacchus, Dong-A Pharmaceutical's flagship products, was recently notified of a temporary suspension of delivery. Currently, delivery is being resumed, but the size of the contract has been reduced and the exclusive right has also been lifted. In response, Dong-A Pharmaceutical explained that the size of the contract was reduced in the process of diversifying suppliers to secure stable raw materials.Some have linked Dong-A Pharmaceutical's stake purchase to its succession structure. If JCOM is acquired, Dong-A Pharmaceutical can stably secure a friendly stake currently held by JCOM. As of Monday, Dong-A Pharmaceutical's stock price was 10,000 won. Based on this, about 100 million won must be invested to hold a stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical. However, Dong-A Pharmaceutical invested about 100 million won to acquire a stake in J-Com, so Dong-A Pharmaceutical acquired a stake in J-Com in order to secure a stake with less money.In response, Dong-A Pharmaceutical said, ""The absolute number of shares seems to be insufficient, but shareholders trust management because of its good performance such as management performance and growth, so there is no shortage of shares."" As announced in the announcement of the stake purchase, it said that it is nothing more than a stake purchase for a strategic partnership. Jacob also said there was no management dispute with Dong-A Pharmaceutical. In fact, when rumors of a management dispute broke out, these companies signed a comprehensive business partnership to strengthen their competitiveness in the pharmaceutical business last month.They explained that they secured shares in terms of stock investment because of the fact that joint research is possible in bio fields such as anticancer aids, which overlap with each other, and the possibility of future growth.Do studies on mobile.",,,,
"Dong-A Pharmaceutical and JCOM have formed a comprehensive business partnership for the pharmaceutical business, including anticancer drugs and biosimilars. As a result, the possibility of disputes has been greatly reduced ahead of the shareholders' meeting of Wol Dong-A Pharmaceutical.Dong-A Pharmaceutical and JCOM announced that they agreed to cooperate in the biopharmaceutical business, including the development of anticancer drugs in Japan and the study of protein treatments using transgenic animals in distribution. In addition, JCOM's exclusive supply of raw materials, which had been decreasing, will remain at the current level.An official from Dong-A Pharmaceutical said, ""We have formed a comprehensive partnership with Dong-A Pharmaceutical to jointly promote J-Com's projects,"" adding, ""J-Com will be able to sell anti-cancer drugs and protein drugs through Dong-A Pharmaceutical.""It also explained that the two companies will jointly conduct clinical trials of anticancer drugs currently under development, and that JCOM will be able to jointly research projects that are being studied through external services with researchers at Dong-A Pharmaceutical.Meanwhile, Dong-A Pharmaceutical Co. and J-Com Co. announced a dispute over management rights ahead of the shareholders' meeting earlier this year by reducing contracts for supplying raw materials between the two companies and purchasing stakes in the two companies.The subsidiary and CEO Kang Yong-seok of J-Com, Park Young-sook, drew a stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical in secret, and Dong-A Pharmaceutical cut off the supply of raw materials such as Taurin supplied by J-Com last month, and bought a stake in J-Com out of the market.JCOM's subsidiary, BTC Farm, currently owns Dong-A Pharmaceutical Co., and if it includes shares of JCOM and CEO Kang Park, it will have a stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical Co. If Dong-A Pharmaceutical acquires JCOM, it can secure a friendly stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical and solve the low stake problem of the current management to some extent.

"Dong-A Pharmaceutical and JCOM, which had recently been suspected of a management dispute due to mutual acquisition of shares, formed a friendly relationship through a business partnership.According to Japanese-related industries, JCOM and Dong-A Pharmaceutical signed a comprehensive business partnership on the same day to strengthen their competitiveness in the pharmaceutical business.In the future, the two companies decided to cooperate in bio-business areas such as developing and selling drugs such as anticancer drugs and research on protein treatments using transgenic animals.A Jacob official said, ""We will first sell Mugard, a cancer treatment supplement, through Dong-A Pharmaceutical if it is approved by the KFDA,"" and added, ""The two companies will jointly conduct clinical trials of the anticancer drug Froindac.""The business agreement between the two companies is expected to end rumors of management disputes that have been raised so far. JCOM secured a stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical through its subsidiaries in the second half of last year. In response, Dong-A Pharmaceutical recently bought an over-the-counter stake in JCOM.There have been rumors in the stock market that Jacob will join hands with Hanmi Pharmaceutical, a major shareholder of Dong-A Pharmaceutical, to work on Dong-A Pharmaceutical.

At the end of last year, Kang Jung-seok, CEO of Dong-A Pharmaceutical Co., was once again rumored to be in conflict. This is because JCOM threatened management rights by securing a stake in Dong-A Pharmaceutical.Kang has reportedly been seeking to resume the business since he sold his stake in JCOM with his mother, Park, this month. Since the sale of the stake reached KRW 100 million at the time, ammunition was sufficiently prepared.

However, it is pointed out that Hwang Woo-suk's craze is likely to be a vain wind as there is no movement.Dr. Hwang's name was mentioned again on the stock market last month, when Kang Yong-seok, his brother-in-law and former president of KOSDAQ company JCOM, reported to the Financial Supervisory Service that he owns a stake in Dongguk Unemployment in KOSPI-listed companies.

"There are a series of rumors such as KMSI's acquisition promotion. Beyond the daily fluctuation, Woori Pharmaceutical's stock price has continued to soar and fall due to a series of recent news related to the sale. The daily fluctuation has exceeded the daily range as rumors have been known to the market that the transfer of management rights will be sold to unlisted bio companies since the contract was terminated once last month.According to the work-related industry, there were two rumors about the sale of Wooridul Pharmaceutical Co. in the morning of the last day. That KMSI is seeking to acquire Woori Pharmaceutical. KMSI is a subsidiary of Sinozen, which was expelled from the stock market last month, and Joo Kwang-sun, a close aide to former Seoul National University professor Hwang Woo-suk, is serving as a director.As these rumors spread, Woori Pharmaceutical's stock price went straight to the upper limit. The Korea Exchange's oil price market headquarters immediately demanded an inquiry disclosure, but it had already accumulated more than 10,000 shares in the remaining upper limit. However, as Woori Pharmaceutical denied the rumors of the sale in response to the inquiry disclosure in the afternoon that day, the rise was reduced.Since then, Woori Life Science Vice Chairman, who was in charge of the sale, said he is discussing the sale with domestic pharmaceutical companies and Japanese pharmaceutical companies, closing the market on a won-rise from the previous trading day.Stock prices of Hwang Woo-suk-related stocks, including DBS ST Cube and JCom, were also fluctuating in relation to KMSI, which was mentioned as the acquisition agent. Speculation that Hwang Woo-suk's division might return to the stock market stimulated speculation.DBS soared at the beginning of the market and approached the upper limit, but the rise has been greatly reduced since Woori Pharmaceutical's official position was announced, closing the won-up from the previous trading day. In addition, ESCUBE JCOM also surged during the day, but posted an upward trend.On the same day, Han Eui-sang, vice chairman of Woori Life Science, said, ""We are discussing the sale with one domestic pharmaceutical company and one Japanese pharmaceutical company after officially saying that we are in discussion."" He also added that he will have a meeting with the owner of a Japanese pharmaceutical company next week regarding the sale.Meanwhile, some experts still questioned the sale of Wooridul Pharmaceutical, which has been swayed by rumors. Even if it is sold, rumors of the sale were repeated, and some predicted that the sale price could be reduced while the stock price was sluggish.Woori Pharmaceutical was established by Woori Hospital in the year when it acquired water drugs to enter the pharmaceutical business. However, management performance was not good due to a series of tax audits and a recession. Net profit for the current year was 100 million won, 100 million won, 100 million won, and 100 million won in debt, and eventually it is undergoing the sale process.Last month, he signed a contract to transfer management rights to Park Joon-young, a private business operator, for KRW 100 million, but it failed because the transferee failed to pay the price. Stock prices also rose to the upper limit on Monday, when the contract was announced, but failed to continue their upward trend after the contract was lifted, showing sluggish performance in the one-box sector for a year.An official from a securities firm said, ""The market's confidence has dropped significantly due to continuous rumors about the sale of Woori Pharmaceutical,"" adding, ""We will succeed in selling it someday, but we may have to reduce the size of the original sale due to poor performance and stock prices.""

"What about the year-end report cards of companies that started to improve their financial structure by designating them as financial structure grades by bond financial institutions last month? Some companies received blood transfusions through mergers and acquisitions and some went into rehabilitation with their own funds. Some companies were delisted and disappeared.One thing in common is that the stock market is getting cold feet. The stock price of companies that succeeded in doing so has been strong, but companies that have no visible results in their own funds or workouts continue to be sluggish.Last month, major commercial banks conducted a credit risk assessment to narrow down their financial rating. The list was not disclosed for fear of side effects, but some construction companies and listed companies were disclosed through the Korea Exchange's inquiry disclosure.Among listed companies, the listing has been maintained so far. Representative examples include mid-sized construction companies such as Namgwang Construction, Byeoksan Construction, Jungang Construction, and Seongji Construction, as well as MB Seongsan Jaeyoung Solutec. Neosemitech and Tom Boy went through the process of delisting due to the rejection of audit opinions and the final bankruptcy.The monthly stock prices of individual companies were sluggish.

"Koryo Porymou's cosmetics for 10 million won in face value.Kim Jae-hong's stocks, which are more than 10,000 won worth of face value converted to 1,000 won from education and confectionery, have recently diversified into nuclear power plants, cosmetics and confectionery.However, these emperor stocks are also unable to hold the flag in front of preferred stocks according to the highest price calculated by converting the face value into 1,000 won. This is because preferred stocks have soared to the ceiling regardless of the designation of investment warning stocks, overshadowing the exchange's market monitoring and management functions.According to the Korea Exchange, the closing price of Koryo Foremer's preferred stock is 10,000 won as of today, which is 10 million won, the price of a medium-sized car, if converted into 1,000 won in face value. This is almost twice the price of KEPCO Technology's 10,000 won, the highest common stock price.Koryo Porymou soared to 10,000 won early this month, continuing its daily limit, regardless of the designation of investment warning stocks by the Market Monitoring Committee of the Starting Exchange as a starting point. The number of listed stocks in Koryo Porymou is only a share, but it has been traded for the past week. The common stock of Goryeo Pomer was KRW, and even if the par value was converted to KRW 1,000, it was only KRW 1,000.Koryo Foremer is not the only preferred stock whose stock price has soared due to such an abnormal price structure. If the face value is converted to 1,000 won, Dongbang Agrow also reaches 10 million won as of today, and there are more than 10,000 won in stocks such as Chungnam Bangbangwoo Sunsan Heavywoo Daechangwoo Hermes Holdingswoo Jino Systemwoo Energy and Chemical Excellence.Stock market experts pointed out that securities authorities such as the Korea Exchange and the Financial Supervisory Service, which have been neglecting trading at such abnormal prices, are more problematic, although no investor thinks such preferred stocks are emperor stocks that reflect corporate value.It is possible that the market management agency, the exchange, and the FSS, the supervisory agency, have been sitting on their hands for too long, citing existing laws and regulations.Meanwhile, on the securities and KOSDAQ markets, emperor stocks with a face value of more than 10,000 won were counted as dogs as of the last day.This is more than double the number of emperor stocks at the end of the year, when the KOSDAQ market heated up due to the dot-com boom, compared to those of KOSDAQ market dogs and securities market dogs.According to the recent imperialism, KEPCO Technology, NCsoft Materials, Telecom Portal, Insurance, Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance, Mega Study, Logistics Glovis, Manufacturing Taekwang Industry, Construction, Confectionery, Lotte Confectionery, Cosmetics, AmorePacific, etc. are widely distributed.At the time of the month of last year, Hwang Je-ju was in the related industries such as Daum Saerom Technology and Locus, and KOSDAQ stocks were definitely strong.

"Coin stocks, which fall short of the price of gum, are increasing significantly.While the KOSDAQ market has rarely gained strength, with the lowest level of the year, the number of coin stocks with stock prices falling short of the won has increased significantly.According to the Korea Exchange, as of the same day, there were a total of less than KRW coins in the KOSDAQ market. That's an increase compared to dogs earlier this year.Specifically, it is the place where Wonmi Bay is located.Among them, the cheapest stock price was Ocean Global, which was traded at KRW per share until the decision to suspend liquidation sales. The market capitalization is 100 million won.Ocean Global was in the process of liquidating the delisting due to the rejection of the audit opinion, but the scheduled delisting process has been suspended as the company's application for an injunction to ban the delisting of stock certificates was cited last month.Cheil Industrial Investment, which was decided to be delisted, was also undergoing a clearance sale at a won, which is more expensive than Ocean Global, but for the same reason, trading has been suspended since last month.Among the stocks currently traded, Clasta is the lowest. On the same day, the market rose far above the market's growth rate, but the closing price was won.Shinopex Green Tech Hallim Chang-to Hesbon L&Pianus, etc. were named as the disgraceful top players.Experts advised that most low-priced stocks should be especially careful about investment as they move separately from market trends.In particular, investors are required to take a cautious approach as many stocks are designated as management stocks or investment ventilation stocks unfaithful disclosure corporations or are suspended due to embezzlement and breach of trust.Smallcap researchers at a securities firm said, ""Many of the low-priced stocks are designated as management stocks or recent investor-ventilated stocks,"" adding, ""Since these stocks are often driven by individual trading, such as liquidation, it is prohibited to invest.""In fact, among the relevant stocks, transactions related to delisting are suspended, and individual stocks are managed and individual stocks are designated as investment ventilation stocks. In addition, among the non-affiliated individual companies, individual companies recorded operating profit losses last year",,,,
"With the advent of Super Ant, the first time in a securities company to set a record of more than a total number of attendees last month, the story of him has continued on the stock market and has recently become so popular that people call him the god of stocks.The main character of the talk is Jae-sung-gun, who is called the new generation super ant and has attracted more attention as a rare Bok.So who is he and why is he gaining so much popularity? The rising popularity began last year when he recommended stocks for free at his cafe every day to help individual investors recover their principal.Many people are curious about him, who started investing in stocks with the money of 10,000 won to buy and succeeded as a super ant, and his success story is famous enough to be reported in the majority of the media and is now a legend.In addition, he appeared on most broadcasts as a billionaire and set an example that he could succeed even at a young age, making headlines.However, his life, which had been on a roll, changed a lot as he worked as an analyst. After his success as a super ant, he was offered an analyst scout by numerous companies, and he began his career as an analyst in earnest, setting a record of being the youngest in Korea at that time.And even at the time of his activities, he was selected as the best expert in a short period of time, and he did not miss the best position anywhere. However, I felt skeptical about the life of an analyst who had to pursue the company's interests, and now I retired, saying, ""I want to do something worthwhile rather than money and honor.""At first, he helped people in need by volunteering after retirement, but when he remembered his difficult times as he saw people struggling with stocks around him, he decided to help individual investors recover their principal.In addition, while considering providing investment information to individual investors who lost money, a stock cafe was opened to allow anyone to receive investment information without burden. The reason is that they opened a stock cafe that is familiar to people so that they don't feel pressured to visit them.And the first thing that started at the same time as the opening of the cafe was to recommend real-time stocks for free every day to help individual investors choose the stocks that they have the most difficult time.Since it was a stock cafe opened without anyone knowing, the number of members was only a club, but the recommended item had a high hit rate and rumors spread that the principal was recovered only with free recommended items, and this part became an issue.Year after year, he still offers free daily recommendations for individual investors and can be found in his current cafe.Even if his efforts cannot change the stock market, his appearance in the world of materialism has shocked people and once again made them feel that money cannot fill everything.Market Analysis Research Stocks Oil and Gas Automotive Parts Innovation Far East Oil Window Oil Eye Energy Leadkop Central Energy Bis East Asia Cement Heunggu Oil Eco Ocean Metal Korea Frenzy CPI Global Peace Industry New Material Nexentech Power Company Hyundai Wai Chemicals Control Yura Hyundai Engineering Co., LtdAPSTECH OTECH Clean & Science Cheongbo Industry Nextek Geumho Tire NEXCENTE Tire Duol Industry Room GNGGNG Non-ferrous Metal General Holding Company Publishing Automobile Korea Zinc Gold STZoil Aluminum Sennit Dongkuk SPJ Metal Backlighting Hanchang Industry Shine Youngpung Metal Samuminium Holding Co., Ltd.
