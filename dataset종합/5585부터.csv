0,"Signal Entertainment Group, an entertainment agency with stars such as Lee Mi-yeon and Song Seung-heon, raised suspicions of embezzlement and breach of trust, including the largest shareholder change this year alone. The company's stock price has fallen by more than a whopping amount this year. Stock prices plunged due to a series of controversial measures, including the issuance of convertible bonds and the change of the largest shareholder twice. To make matters worse, as the situation worsened, including concerns over delisting, minority shareholders who failed to see it took collective action.Minority shareholders of Ilseignal Entertainment Group said they will hold them accountable for the change in their largest shareholders last month and the free reduction last month and demand normalization of their management. They criticize that management, including the company's largest shareholder, is busy filling up its profits while neglecting shareholder rights.Kim In-sun, who leads the shareholder movement, said in a telephone conversation that the company is refusing to talk to shareholders, adding that opposition lawmakers from the National Policy Committee are also joining forces to make public discussions. According to Kim, the number of shareholders who have expressed their intention to join is more than the total stake and is expected to increase further if they include those who have not yet expressed their intention. Shareholders plan to gather at Gwanghwamun, Shilla Stay, to gather opinions and request a separate meeting of shareholders.The stock price of Signal Entertainment Group, which has accumulated operating losses, has fallen more than this year alone, falling into so-called coin stocks. In particular, the stock price fell to its lowest price last month when it announced its plan to mainly reduce common shareholders. Shareholders are concerned that the two largest shareholder changes this year are linked to management profits and that there may be charges of embezzlement.For this reason, shareholders' position is to prevent the reduction at the general shareholders' meeting and hold management accountable. Kim added that as shareholders want management normalization and stock price recovery, specific evidence data will be disclosed after collecting shareholder opinions.Signal Entertainment Group is an entertainment agency that has entertainers such as Lee Mi-yeon and Song Seung-heon. It is also in the broadcasting film content production business.The Korea Exchange has designated Signal Entertainment Group as a management stock because it has suffered operating losses for a year in a row. If it records operating losses this year, it will be reviewed for delisting. It is possible to delist even if it is found that internal executives and employees are embezzled and are indicted."

KOSDAQ-listed companies that have been on the verge of designating or delisting management items have been revealed one after another after receiving audit opinions such as worsening performance or rejection of opinions. There is fear in the KOSDAQ market as stocks that are suspended due to audit reports are revealed one after another.According to the Korea Exchange, which rejected audit opinions one after another, PT Games, Signal Entertainment Group, M Venture Investment, Woosung Ivy, and Suseong Asset Management Esmark announced that there were reasons for designation or delisting of management items this year.In the KOSDAQ market listing regulations, refusal of an audit opinion constitutes a reason for delisting and an objection may be filed within days from the date of receipt of a notice of delisting. If there is no objection, the delisting process will proceed.The accounting firm audits the company's financial statements and presents an audit opinion that rejects the appropriate opinion, the appropriate opinion, and the inappropriate opinion. Adequate opinions mean that companies can properly prepare financial statements according to accounting standards and be trusted, but limited opinions are usually referred to as inappropriate opinions.Recently, Samjeong Accounting Corporation, which was in charge of auditing PT Games, rejected opinions, one of the reasons for delisting, due to restrictions on the scope of audit opinions on financial statements for this fiscal year.

Companies that have incurred reasons such as operating losses for consecutive years or capital erosion for more than a year will be subject to a substantial review of delisting.Recently, M Venture Investment has been designated as a management item due to operating losses for consecutive business years. M Venture Investment made an operating loss of 100 million won last year. The possibility of designating a management item was constantly worrisome as it recorded a deficit for consecutive years. For this reason, in the disclosure of the submission of the audit report, it was disclosed that the auditor's audit opinion on the financial statements for the recent business year was rejected due to the scope limitation. Cody and Am High also suffered operating losses in a series of recent business years, causing reasons for designation of management items or delisting. Cody's operating loss last year was 100 million won, compared to the previous year. It has deteriorated, and Am High's operating loss last year was higher than the previous year. It was tallied at an increase of 100 million won.If it is necessary to take care of the emphasis on banning the appropriate blind faith of investors, is it a safe stock for auditors to make appropriate opinions as audit opinions?

If a listed company and an accounting auditor agree that it is necessary to prepare an audit report and report it, the deadline for submission can be postponed until up to business days.Accordingly, Kumho Tire and Reisen can submit business reports by Sunday.The exchange plans to receive documents later than usual, without ruling out the possibility that Majesta and J.

56,"As the end of the month, which is the deadline for submitting audit reports by monthly settlement corporations, a number of companies have been delisted according to the audit results on the securities KOSDAQ market. Investors are required to pay attention because most of them cannot avoid delisting if a reason for delisting occurs, and they often plunge abnormally during liquidation sales.According to the Korea Exchange in Japan, all companies that caused delisting due to inappropriate audit opinions in the audit report for the fiscal year until the same day were counted. This is an increase in the number of new companies compared to the previous year. It has more than doubled compared to the number of years. It has increased significantly over the past year.Auditing opinions of accounting firms on listed companies are divided into appropriate limited and inappropriate rejection. At this time, listed companies that received negative opinions can file an objection within the day from the date of notification of delisting, and deliberation by the corporate review committee will take place within the day from the date of the objection.There are two companies in the securities market, Sungji Construction and Sehwa IMC, which are on the verge of leaving the stock market due to the rejection of opinions in this year's audit report by external auditors. The Hanyoung accounting firm, which is in charge of auditing Sungji Construction, said Sungji Construction Co. is counting hundreds of millions of won in deposits for carrying out construction orders, but it has not secured sufficient audit evidence on whether the deposits are real and appropriate. Sehwa IMC has not disclosed its business report as of Sunday, so the reason for Samjeong Accounting Corporation's refusal of opinion has not been confirmed.On the KOSDAQ market, the reason for delisting occurred as Suseong Woosung Ivy Party Games M Venture Investment Signal Entertainment FT&N rejected the audit opinion from Am High Gamma Nugidi Trace SAA Asset Management Steel Flower Hansol Intecube DSK Cathea.Some listed companies announced the suspension of stock trading and the decision to reject opinions immediately after raising stock prices due to favorable factors such as cooperation with large companies, causing damage to investors.Trace, a KOSDAQ-listed company, announced on its website last month that it has been jointly developing transparent fingerprint recognition modules for smartphones with Samsung Electronics since last year, hitting the upper limit on the same day. However, not long after, the transaction was suspended due to the reason for delisting on the same month.Mercury, another listed company, hit the upper limit during the day last month, but the Korea Exchange demanded the disclosure of the inappropriate audit opinion and suspended trading later that day. Mercury later announced that it had received a rejection of its opinion due to uncertainty about its viability as a continuing company.Experts advise that if the delisting is confirmed and the sale begins, stock prices often plunge, so in order not to lose money, it is necessary to find out if there are no signs of delisting before investment.Choi Sung-hwan, a researcher at Research Alum, an independent research institute, said, ""If the transaction is suspended due to a reason for delisting, no measures are meaningless,"" adding, ""To avoid the risk of delisting, avoid investment if there is a continuous operating deficit for years.""An accountant said, ""The increase in the number of companies that caused delisting this year is clearly due to the strengthening of audits by each auditor,"" adding, ""It is better to avoid companies that are unstable in financial statements as the introduction of a designated audit system next year is likely to strengthen."""
57,"Zika virus manufacturer GenBody, which was even mentioned as a trillion won in market capitalization this year, received limited opinions from audit opinions due to lack of evidence for basic inventory. Samdeok Accounting Corp., a designated auditor, explained that it did not have sufficient data on inventory as a basis for limiting the audit opinion.Companies that were preparing to be listed within the year also accepted the rejection of audit opinions from accounting firms, designated auditors, ahead of submission of audit reports late last month. This is because the consolidated subsidiary did not have enough accounting evidence. Sales of subsidiaries in question do not account for bonds compared to the company's total sales, but the company has no choice but to accept the results due to the lack of explanatory data.According to the Korea Exchange and the Financial Supervisory Service, listed companies declined or received limited opinions from external auditors in their audit reports for the fiscal year.On the KOSPI, two Seongji Construction and Sehwa IMC received rejection of their opinions, while Hansol Intecube Hansol P&S Samkwang Glass received limited opinions. At KOSDAQ, FTN is Gamma Nu NexG Signal Entertainment, S A Trace Am High GD M Venture Investment Party Games Woosung Ivy Mercury Asset Management DSK Catea Steel Flower.In addition, according to the industry, the number of unlisted companies that received opinions that rejected audit opinions ahead of the deadline for submitting audit reports this year has increased compared to previous years. As accounting firms strengthened audit standards due to Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering's accounting fraud, accounting mistakes of some KOSDAQ-listed companies and unlisted corporations are being detected through audits.Auditing opinions on companies subject to audit presented by accounting firms are classified into inappropriate and limited rejection of opinions. Except for appropriateness, the rejection of limited inappropriate opinions is a reason for delisting in the case of listed companies.If the company does not raise an objection within business days, it will automatically go through the delisting process. Party Games, a KOSDAQ-listed company, has also withdrawn its paid-in capital increase worth 100 million won due to the rejection of audit opinions.In the case of unlisted companies, they are not subject to the same sanctions as listed companies, but in the case of companies preparing for the, the listing period will be delayed by at least a year because the reliability of business reports will be significantly lowered. In fact, companies that were preparing to list special technology cases last year postponed the listing schedule for more than a year due to the audit opinion of designated auditors.An industry source said, ""In the case of start-ups and technology companies that do not have enough financial experts, accounting mistakes are often found in the audit process of accounting firms.""Why Kim Jong Un fell into Red Velvet's charms?

58,"When Kumho Tire's Raygen CCS and other companies did not submit audit reports, a number of companies received inappropriate opinions or failed to submit audit reports in the wake of the settlement season of investor damage concerns. Many of them are on the verge of delisting, and investors are expected to suffer considerable damage.According to the Electronic Disclosure System of the Korea Exchange and the Financial Supervisory Service, all companies were rejected or limited by external auditors' opinions in the fiscal year audit report. Two companies that were rejected were Seongji Construction in the securities market and Sehwa IMC. On the KOSDAQ, a number of places including FT E&E Steel Flower A. Race, IMHIGAM ManunexG Signal Entertainment, M Venture Investment Party Games, Woosung Ivy Non-Aqueous Asset Management, and DSCatea accepted the rejection. Listed companies with limited opinions have also been listed, including Samkwang Glass in the securities market, Hansol Intecube and Cha Biotech in the Hansol P&S KOSDAQ market. If an external auditor's opinion on the audit report is inappropriate or rejected, the exchange will suspend the transaction and take steps to exit if there is no objection within business days.Many companies have failed to submit audit reports. In securities, Kumho Tire and Reisen C, Esmasesta, J. Stefan Moda, etc. failed to submit an audit report until this day. If the audit results are likely to have received inappropriate opinions and fail to submit an audit report, it is likely to lead to delisting due to the failure to submit a business report. Some companies have applied for an extension of the deadline for submitting business reports. According to the regulations, if these companies fail to submit business reports with audit reports by next month, they will be designated as management items and if they do not submit them within the next day, they will be kicked out of the stock market.Meanwhile, shareholders' meetings of several companies were held on the last day of the general shareholders' season. KOSDAQ companies Suntech and Holdings failed to handle basic issues such as approval of financial statements or approval of remuneration limits for directors and auditors. Kisan Telecom and Wave Electro-Twin Global failed to appoint auditors. This year, the attendance rate of minority shareholders at the shareholders' meeting has fallen due to the abolition of shadow voting, and the number of companies whose audit appointment agenda has been rejected has soared. Woongjin Energy, Youngwoo, and DSP have also been rejected on the issue of granting stock options.

59,"Amid a growing number of listed companies in the local stock market that receive more than double the existing audit fees and do not receive audit opinions from auditors, complaints are being raised that accounting firms set re-audit fees ridiculously high. Listed companies that have not received appropriate opinions on external audit reports in the settlement season will be delisted if they fail to resolve inappropriate reasons through re-audit. It was found that accounting firms use this to receive re-audit fees that are more than twice the existing audit fees.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, the total number of companies that received inappropriate opinions from external auditors in the audit report for the fiscal year until Sunday was counted as total companies that caused delisting. Mercury Woosung Ivy Asset Management Steel Flower NexG Hansol Intecube and others were included. Including the companies that have yet to submit audit reports, the number of KOSDAQ companies in crisis is expected to increase. The industry expects more than total new companies to receive inappropriate opinions this year. Compared to the previous year, the figure has increased. It has more than doubled compared to a year ago. In the case of KOSDAQ-listed companies, the rejection of inappropriate opinions as an audit opinion is a reason for immediate delisting if KOSPI companies receive an inappropriate rejection of opinions.The accounting firm industry interpreted the audit of Deloitte Anjin accounting firm as a result of being more meticulous than before when it was suspended last year on charges of acquiescing Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering's accounting fraud. Analysts say that the company will conduct a practical audit to protect investors.However, it is pointed out that the behavior of setting re-audit fees using the situation of marginal companies trying to avoid delisting should disappear. The industry's voice is that accounting firms are cleverly using the sentiment that listed companies, which are on the brink of delisting, can pay dozens of times the existing audit fees to avoid the crisis of delisting. In fact, KOSDAQ-listed companies, which received re-audit last year, reportedly paid more than 100 million won in fees. The company, which received limited audit opinions in its audit report for the fiscal year, has been out of the crisis since it was revised to a monthly audit opinion review last year. External audit fees for KOSDAQ-listed companies are usually less than 100 million won.Listed companies that have received inappropriate opinions will be suspended from trading stocks until the final decision is made on whether to delist them. Listed companies will take steps to delist if they do not file an objection within business days from the date of receipt of the notice related to delisting. Listed companies that have filed objections must submit expert confirmations on the results of the implementation of the re-audit report improvement plan to the exchange to resume stock trading. First of all, companies sign a re-audit contract with an accounting firm and undergo re-audit from the month.An official from KOSDAQ-listed companies said, ""The peak season of accounting firms is the monthly audit season and the off-season starts from the month,"" adding, ""I don't understand that they receive high re-audit fees even though they are relatively free."" He then pointed out that more and more companies are reviving through re-audit after rejecting audit opinions, and that small and medium-sized companies are complaining of difficulties due to the money business of accounting firms. In fact, among the prepositions that received an inappropriate audit opinion last year, prepositions such as Alpha Holdings, J. Stephen Nano's Rekem, Semi-Conlight Bident, were re-audited and re-audited. In the year, the listed company that survived through re-audit was Gaesa.An accounting firm official said, ""As class action lawsuits have continued since last year, external audits of listed companies have become stricter,"" adding, ""In particular, external audits of KOSDAQ-listed companies are based on strict standards, ranging from a few years ago to eligibility as a major shareholder."" He then explained that outside the usual process, it may be more expensive than existing external audit fees, but that few accounting firms are actively seeking to re-audit companies with high risk by paying more fees.Reporter Lim Hyesun...

60,"A surprising disclosure was posted on the electronic disclosure system on Monday night. This is because Cha Biotech's accounting audit report, which has a market capitalization of KRW trillion for the development of stem cell treatments and various other bio-health care businesses, has been posted as a limited opinion.And Cha Biotech was immediately designated as a management item by the Korea Exchange, and the daily lower limit and the market capitalization fell further in the afternoon, almost halved in less than a week from about trillion won to trillion won.What on earth has happened? Let's take a quick look at it for those who weren't interested in accounting. If the accounting firm has no objection to the company's performance and financial statements, an appropriate opinion is presented. However, even if there is no problem with the financial statements, if it is difficult for the company to continue to survive, it raises uncertainties about its ability to continue to survive. The stock called Woosung Ivy recently received a rejection of its audit opinion from an accounting firm for this reason.But the case of Cha Biotech is a little different. It is not that the company's ability to continue to survive, that is, it was difficult to manage or failed to repay its debts, so it did not receive an appropriate audit opinion. The company's announced operating profit was .100 million won, but the accounting firm insisted that it should be revised and announced as .100 million won in operating profit.However, Cha Biotech does not accept the accounting firm's claim.The company will announce operating profit of 100 million won as it is. Because the company did not accept the accounting firm's recommendation, the accounting firm failed to present an appropriate opinion and presented a limited opinion, meaning that only the cost-related parts did not agree. To put it simply, the limited opinion means that it is appropriate except for it, which was Cha Biotech's investment cost of about KRW 100 million.Then, why couldn't Cha Biotech accept the opinion of the accounting firm? If Cha Biotech accepts the opinion of the accounting firm and loses business.If he had announced 100 million won, he could have received an appropriate opinion. The deficit does not mean that the company will fail, but why did it receive a limited opinion because of the relatively small amount of KRW 100 million compared to the company's sales volume?It is believed that it was probably due to the KOSDAQ listing regulations. On the KOSDAQ market, if an operating deficit is recorded for consecutive years, it is designated as a management item. And later, if there is another operating deficit, it may be withdrawn from the stock market. Cha Biotech has been in the operating deficit for several years, so if the operating deficit was announced in the year, it could be designated as a management item. If designated as a management item, it will also be subject to various sanctions from the exchange, but most importantly, a fall in stock prices is inevitable in the stock market. In particular, fund managers who cannot invest in management items have no choice but to sell Cha Biotech, which is designated as a management item, and management items are banned from credit transactions, which will also negatively affect stock prices.Therefore, it seems that Cha Biotech tried not to enter the management category by maintaining the operating surplus even if it received limited opinions from the accounting firm.However, the problem is that the Korea Exchange did not admit it. The Korea Exchange has an operating deficit as claimed by the accounting firm.The KRW 100 million determined Cha Biotech's actual annual performance and therefore notifies the designation of management items as operating deficits for consecutive years. As a result, stock prices have fallen sharply since Monday.What matters here is not whether Cha Biotech's true performance is a surplus of 100 million won or a deficit of 100 million won. Whether Cha Biotech is in a surplus of 100 million won or a deficit of 100 million won, the company that is clinicalizing stem cell treatments remains unchanged and it is not a ruined company because it has no money right now.In addition, it is an operating deficit for consecutive years, but in terms of consolidated financial statements as a separate financial statement, Cha Biotech recorded a deficit only in the year because it was a large-scale operating surplus. Therefore, Cha Biotech is not designated as a management item if it is judged as a consolidation criterion.In the end, Cha Biotech's designation of management items, a sharp drop in stock prices, and the resulting impact on the pharmaceutical bio sector results in institutional problems. Now, let's talk about some of the issues that investors can raise about the designation of Cha Biotech's management items.First, Cha Biotech suffered a continuous deficit on a separate basis, but this is due to investment costs. Investment is an essential expenditure for bio companies. The exchange is relatively tolerant of companies that record deficits in investment costs. A typical example is the listing of special technologies, and Cha Biotech belongs to the same industry, but this regulation is strictly applied because it is not a special listing of technologies.Second, Cha Biotech is not a company with an operating deficit for consecutive years based on a consolidation basis. In the year, it recorded an operating surplus of about 100 million won on a consolidated basis. It's not that I don't have money. In addition, it also has a subsidiary with significant sales and profits that it owns more than the shares of a company called Pharmaceutical. It is a company that has ample financial power and assets, and generates profits if it includes subsidiaries. However, the regulation on the designation and delisting of management items of the exchange is judged based on separate financial statements. There may certainly be some who raise doubts about whether this is reasonable.Third, depending on whether the investment cost is an asset or an expense that will contribute to the future company's profit generation, the cost can be an asset or an expense. However, this is a very difficult content to judge whether it is absolutely right or wrong. Although there are definitely conventions and criteria for judgment, it is difficult to say that they are absolute. This is because controversy can always be raised and the issue of judgment plays a big role.Fourth, there are no regulations on the designation or delisting of management items due to continuous operating deficits in the securities listing market. Although it is a system for protecting investors in the KOSDAQ market, side effects may occur. Even if there is an operating deficit for consecutive years or consecutive years, some people may raise the issue of equity in that these regulations are applied only to the KOSDAQ market, although delisting or management items are not designated in the securities market.Finally, in order to avoid designation and delisting of management items due to continuous operating deficits, the company may make efforts to turn the company into a surplus company using legal methods or expedients. In accounting circles, this is called profit adjustment to avoid deficits. It may be pointed out that exchange regulations may lead to a situation that encourages the company's profit adjustment motivation.It is natural for a company to disclose its information as truthfully as transparent as possible. However, if the regulation is applied uniformly without considering the characteristics of the business, it may rather affect capital market confusion and efficient allocation of social resources.The exchange's regulations must satisfy both investor protection and efficient allocation of resources. In fact, Cha Biotech is a company with sufficient conditions to achieve a surplus without making an operating deficit based on separate financial statements with a little effort.However, the role of the capital market is not to allow companies to develop various tricks to somehow report surpluses, but to focus on their main jobs and creating future value.Strict compliance with exchange regulations is of course important. However, it is also a matter to consider through this case whether the original purpose of the regulation is efficiently achieved by comprehensively considering both the situation and characteristics of the company.Choi Byung-chul, accountant Choi Byung-chul, worked for Samil Accounting Corporation and experienced various tasks such as accounting audit consulting.

61,"A delisting warning was issued ahead of the deadline for submitting an audit report on stocks that are likely to be unsubmitted, such as J.Stefan CNplus, if there is no objection after rejecting opinions from GDNEX. Critics point out that companies that have failed to submit audit reports by the deadline or have not received appropriate opinions should pay attention to their investments due to growing concerns over their exit from the stock market.According to the Financial Supervisory Service's electronic disclosure, GDNEX's Gammanue Imha Asset Management Trace Steel Flower FT&E Party Games Signal Entertainment M Venture Investment Woosung Ivy, which recently submitted an audit report, was rejected by an accounting firm. Haengnamja SEA Biotech and others received limited notification. In particular, Cha Biotech received limited opinions by recording deficits for consecutive years due to changes in accounting standards, and its stock price plunged to the price limit. The company said, ""We plan to quickly restructure the business so that it can be removed from the management category by implementing a surplus in the shortest time,"" adding, ""We will come up with car measures to improve profits next week.""According to the manufacture of the Enforcement Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, external auditors must submit audit reports to the company no later than a week before the regular shareholders' meeting. The monthly settlement corporation has to hold a general shareholders' meeting by this month, so the work is the deadline for the audit report.In accordance with the regulations, the exchange suspends the transaction if an external auditor's opinion on the audit report is inappropriate or the opinion is limited. Both non-conformity and rejection of opinions are classified as non-appropriate. If there is no objection within business days after the transaction is suspended, the delisting process will proceed.The problem is that many of these companies, despite their worsening financial status, jumped on the rise in stock prices last year and issued a large number of convertible bonds or bonds with underwriting rights. Companies that have lost their ability to raise funds have drawn funds by issuing private bonds, and investors have bet on rising stock prices in the strong market atmosphere, digesting most of these quantities, but the delisting has cost them a lot. The audit report pointed out that these companies failed to secure suitable audit evidence in transactions with related parties. They say that it is suspicious enough that it is not possible to prove in detail how the funds were raised and used.Listed companies that are delayed in submitting audit reports are also subject to attention.

Among them, all companies except Hansol Intecube DSK Catea Moda have submitted objections.The exchange also newly designated KOSPI-listed companies as management stocks. The reason is that Hansol and Samkwang Glass, which are under-sales of Ailets, have limited audit opinions due to restrictions on the scope of audit, and Albozen Korea lacks stock distribution requirements. The designation of management stocks was lifted for the opening of Daesung Industrial and other companies as the capital was abnormally eroded. The capital erosion rate is high, and Daesung Industrial's capital erosion has been completely resolved. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering also escaped from the management category as the reason for not meeting the audit opinion was resolved.In the KOSDAQ market, the exchange has newly designated companies and places where the reason for delisting occurred as management stocks. Ssangyong Information and Communication Biogenetics Cha Biotech is an example of the reason that Rechem Skin & Skin E-Koren suffered operating losses for consecutive business years due to massive losses. YD Online and Haengnamgi have been designated as managed stocks beyond the capital erosion rate.On the other hand, Sangji Kyle Room, Oriental Precision AT Technology, Dongil Steel, Potis, AT Semicon, and Taeyang C&L, which have been resolved for large-scale losses, have been lifted from management. Korea Semiconductor's Gold Pacific Next Bio Holdings, which was designated as a management item due to continuous operating losses in the opening year, was also canceled.Meanwhile, the place has been newly designated as an investor's ventilation stock in the KOSDAQ market.

Reason for delisting It will be designated as a management item if any reason arises, such as the occurrence of continuous operating losses in the recent business year.In particular, Gamma Nunex magazine and others were rejected by Cha Biotech, a developer of stem cell treatments, for their financial statements last year. In the case of KOSDAQ-listed companies, the limit on the scope of rejection of inappropriate opinions is limited by audit opinions, and KOSPI companies are immediately subject to delisting if they are rejected. If these changes do not file an objection within business days from the date of receipt of the notice related to delisting, they will be removed.Although the deadline for submitting audit reports by listed companies for monthly settlement has expired due to the past, there is a high possibility that more companies will be ineligible for audit opinions, which are the reasons for delisting. The deadline for submitting this year's audit report was a week before the deadline for the general shareholders' meeting. Currently, the opening of KOSPI-listed companies such as Kumho Tire and Busan Corporation and the opening of KOSDAQ-listed companies such as Catea Reisen have not submitted audit reports. Stock market experts believe that companies that failed to submit audit reports on time are likely to be insolvent as the audit process is often not completed due to problems such as providing corporate data. If these companies do not submit a business report with an audit report by next month, the deadline for this year's business report, they will be designated as a management item and will be delisted if they do not submit it within the next day. Among the companies that delayed submission of audit reports, Reisen and Moda J. Stefan have received audit opinions that fall into non-appropriate categories such as rejection of appropriate opinions by the limited government, so the Korea Exchange has demanded an inquiry and suspended trading.Not long after announcing the favorable news of investor damage due to refusal of opinions from the audit, it was announced that it was rejected by an external auditor, requiring caution due to a number of investors who are suffering from suspension or delisting. Shares of KOSDAQ-listed Mercury soared from the previous day to the upper limit. Volume also exceeded Manchuria. The daily trading volume, which was the previous day, was only 10,000 shares, but the trading volume nearly doubled in one day. However, Mercury demanded an inquiry on the theory that the exchange was inappropriate for the audit opinion in the afternoon of the last day when the stock price went into the upper limit. The exchange suspended trading of shares. Mercury later announced that it had submitted an audit report that had been rejected. Mercury investors, who enjoyed the joy of the upper limit price, were immediately suspended from trading due to the occurrence of reasons for delisting.Mercury has submitted an objection to the auditor's refusal of opinion due to restrictions on the scope of audit. In response, the Korea Exchange said it will hold a corporate review committee within days from the date of receiving the objection to deliberate on whether to delist and decide whether to delist within days from the date of deliberation.In the case of Gamma Nu, which caused the reason for delisting due to the rejection of the audit's opinion on the past day, negative factors arose after announcing materials for improved performance. Gamamnu announced in a public announcement on the last day that its consolidated operating profit last year turned into a surplus year-on-year to 100 million won. The gist of the disclosure was that last year's sales increased year-on-year to KRW 100 million in net loss. Gamamnu shares surged the next day due to the market's closing announcement. Trading volume was also nearly double that of Manchuria the previous day. However, when asked by the Korea Exchange to disclose whether the audit opinion is inappropriate and whether it is true or not, Japanese Gamamnu announced that it was rejected through an audit report. The market responded that it was unconvinced that it was rejected by an external auditor just a day after the announcement of improved performance. In addition, companies designated as management items due to persistent deficits or inappropriate audit opinions as a result of settlement of accounts, such as Chabiotec Haengnamja, are also required to pay attention when investing. Stock market experts pointed out that if the audit report is not disclosed in time, the possibility of delisting the company should be suspected.Reporter Shin Dong-ju. Global Media World Daily"
66,"Concerns have grown over failure to submit a report on the risk of delisting due to the rejection of audit opinions by individual companies such as Party Games, and the deadline for submitting an audit report last year is approaching. In addition to being rejected by external auditors, a number of listed companies have also been on the verge of delisting due to accounting violations. Amid growing vigilance against listed companies that failed to submit audit reports by some deadline, it is pointed out that investment should be paid attention as the number of people subject to eviction may increase further depending on the results of the audit report.According to the Financial Supervisory Service, which rejected the audit opinion of listed companies this year, Party Games was suspended from trading stocks after receiving an audit opinion from an external auditor last year. Samjeong Accounting Corp., which audited Game Developer Party Games, a game developer famous for I Love Coffee, did not express its opinion due to a lack of evidence to determine the validity of the transaction and the adequacy of accounting. Party Games parent company Moda was also asked to disclose its audit opinion by the Korea Exchange, and Yellow Mobile, which decided to acquire Moda, withdrew its participation in a paid-in capital increase worth 100 million won.Including Party Games, there are a total of listed companies that have received rejection of audit opinions so far, including Sehwa IMC Sungji Construction in the securities market and Suseong Woosung I.B.M Venture Investment Signal Entertainment Group FT & E in the KOSDAQ market. The rejection of the audit opinion constitutes a reason for delisting, so they can file an objection with the Korea Exchange, and if there is no objection, the delisting process will proceed. CSA received limited opinions due to restrictions on the scope of audit, resulting in reasons for delisting.SIT Global was given an improvement period last year due to allegations of embezzlement worth 100 million won against the former CEO, and the delisting will be decided at the end of the recent improvement period. China Haoran was designated as a subject of substantial screening for listing eligibility due to the suspension of business of its Chinese subsidiary, which accounts for more than the total sales. Last year, the Financial Services Commission's Securities and Futures Commission's supervision of the Securities and Futures Commission was criticized for fines, and recently, it is on the list of comprehensive screening and will be decided next month. Gyeongnam Pharmaceutical was also determined to be eligible for listing due to a violation of accounting standards.Due to the delay in submitting the audit report, the monthly settlement corporation listed on the U.S. stock market is required to submit an audit report from an external auditor a week before the regular shareholders' meeting this month. Considering this, this year's deadline for submission could be extended to an additional number of listed companies that are not eligible for audit opinions as there are companies that are delayed in submitting audit reports until that day. More than half of the companies that received rejection of audit opinions last year also submitted audit reports past the deadline. Last year, in the securities market, the brokerage of dog companies that received rejection of audit opinions on the KOSDAQ was abolished. One of the reasons for the delisting is that operating losses occur for the first consecutive year, and there is a possibility that more companies will be at the crossroads of delisting. In fact, Korea Precision Machinery Co., Ltd. has been confirmed to have suffered operating losses for the past year in a row in its audit report submitted on the same day.Moreover, among companies that have been delayed in submitting audit reports, Reisen has been asked to disclose inquiries by exchanges related to inappropriate audit opinions, and CCS has been accused of embezzlement by the current management. As a result, companies that have been delayed in submitting audit reports, such as a sharp drop in CCS, showed a decline in stock prices. The engine and Coreentec also fell close together. Park Jong-sun, head of the small cap team at Eugene Investment & Securities, said, ""The audit report organizes all the households of the company, so we need to carefully examine whether there are any problems caused by the audit report.""Lee Hoseob's fun free webtoon...

70,"More and more companies have raised large-scale funds through the issuance of mezzanine, such as convertible bonds and bonds with new stock certificates, which are overheated in the KOSDAQ market, but are delisting or barely holding out.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service and others, Kiwi Media Group, a listed company in the securities market, is the most frequently issued company from the year when mezzanine issuance began in earnest in Korea to last year. Kiwi Media Group recorded the issuance of mezzanine at general meetings and meetings during this period. It was followed by Trace Bion Winners in the KOSDAQ market.Many of the top listed companies in the issuance performance have poor financial status. There are also so-called marginal companies. The Korea Exchange's KOSDAQ Market Committee, which issued the general meeting, was notified of the decision to delist it on the last day.Trace Winner's M Venture Investment was also suspended recently after receiving a rejection of an audit opinion from an external accounting Signal Entertainment Group, which was delisted earlier this month, also issued mezzanine issues. An exchange official said, ""More and more people are raising funds with mezzanine for mergers and acquisitions or facility investment, but we should be careful as some insolvent companies are in need of urgent funds.""Among the top listed companies with mezzanine issuance, there are many companies whose issuance exceeds the company's market capitalization. Trace and Winner's issuance has been 100 million won each over the past year, with market capitalization of only 100 million won each before the suspension.An analyst at a securities firm said, ""It is natural for growth companies such as bio to use them to lower procurement costs, but more and more people are in conflict with existing shareholders due to dilution of shares.""Reporter Kim Dong-hyun: Korean economy, prohibition of unauthorized propagation and redistribution"

The reason is that it withdrew after deciding to acquire stocks and investment securities of other corporations. Earlier, the Securities and Futures Commission filed a complaint with the prosecution against Winner's company and former CEO for falsely calculating sales and sales costs and not listing information comments on major customers.Although the government is trying to revitalize the KOSDAQ market, KOSDAQ-listed companies are not fulfilling their disclosure obligations. In order to revitalize the KOSDAQ market, recovery of market confidence from investors should be a priority, but listed companies are actually abandoning it.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, the total number of cases designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations in the KOSDAQ market has reached this year. This is an increase from the same period last year.In particular, it is twice as many as the securities market during the same period.Looking at the cases of unfaithful disclosure by type, the most common cases were non-compliance with disclosure that did not meet the reporting deadline. Subsequently, the reversal of the disclosure was only one change in the disclosure that changed the existing disclosure contents by a certain percentage or more.If it is designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation, penalty points will be imposed, and if the cumulative penalty points exceed the accumulated penalty points within the past year from the date of imposition, it will be designated as a management item or suspended for a certain period of time. If the issue is serious, it can lead to delisting.Last month, a Chinese company, China Ocean Resources, was designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to a series of false disclosures, and even delisting was decided.The problem is that the number of unfaithful disclosure corporations designated does not increase. The number of KOSDAQ unfaithful disclosure corporations designated last year is number. During the same period, it was six times more than the number of designated securities markets. In the year, the number of designated KOSDAQ unfaithful disclosure corporations reached the number.The increase in unfaithful disclosure corporations can lead to distrust in investment. Above all, recovery of market confidence is the key to respond to the government's measures to revitalize the KOSDAQ market.An industry source said, ""As KOSDAQ-listed companies are often more difficult to apply in terms of manpower than KOSPI-listed companies, there are many cases where they are designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations,"" but added, ""In order to meet the government's revitalization policy, we need to fulfill the disclosure obligations.""

101,"The decline of former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was also evident in the stock market. The so-called Ban Ki-moon-themed stocks swept the top stocks in the month.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, Sungmun Electronics was the stock with the highest drop rate in the KOSPI as of last month compared to last year's closing price. Sungmoon Electronics recorded a decline of .during this period, falling from 10,000 won to . The company has been classified as a Ban Ki-moon theme stock because its executive director Shin Joon-sup is close to former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.Ban Ki-moon theme stocks also topped the monthly KOSPI decline rate. They are the ones who are currently working on SCC engineering in Busan Jugong. During the same period, Busan Jugong plunged and SCC Engineering's stock price fell.Choi Seung-hwan is called Ban Ki-moon Theme Stock just because he is serving as a standing member of the U.N. Environmental Plan. As the general president returned to Korea last month, he continued his de facto bid for the presidency, but Ban Ki-moon's theme stocks also seem to be falling as his approval rating continues to fall.Compared to Sungmoon Electronics and Sungmoon Electronics, the reason why Busan Jugong and SCC Engineering were classified as Ban Ki-moon theme stocks is more absurd. This is because the rumor that the CEO is Ban's cousin has spread since last year due to the half-year of Fine Asia Asset Management, which invested in these companies, has been woven into Ban Ki-moon-themed stocks. This is the same with Find&C, which has risen above the KOSDAQ drop rate.He already explained that he was not related to the former president last year. Since then, these stocks have seemed to return their previous gains, but their stock prices have begun to rise again in the last month. At that time, rumors circulated in the stock community that the CEO was a distant relative of former President Ban, and that it was a stock manipulation by so-called operational forces. However, these stocks eventually showed a sharp drop in stock prices again in the new year.The sluggish Ban Ki-moon theme stock can also be seen on the KOSDAQ market. Gwanglim, where Ban's younger brother Ban Ki-ho is an outside director, recorded a monthly decline rate, while Gienco, whose CEO is known as Ban's maternal nephew, also fell. CCS, which operates a cable network in Ban's hometown of North Chungcheong Province, also fell during the period.On the other hand, the newly emerging theme stock is Hwang Kyo-ahn's theme stock. InterM, one of the leading Hwang Kyo-ahn theme stocks, rose from won to won during the month, marking an increase of .InterM is classified as Hwang Kyo-ahn's theme stock after it was revealed that Cho Soon-koo is an alumnus of Sungkyunkwan University, the same as Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn. InterM's stock price is also on the rise as Hwang is emerging as a new presidential candidate for the ruling party and his approval rating is on the rise.Events related to former Democratic Party leader Moon Jae In, who is a presidential candidate representing the opposition party and is also ranking above the overall approval rating, were mixed. Steel, which is classified as a Moon Jae In theme stock because its CEO Hong Ha-jong graduated from Kyungnam High School like Moon, rose from won to 10,000 won during the month. This figure is above the KOSPI's growth rate.In particular, steelmaking has hit record highs one after another since mid-month, rising to 10,000 won at one point during the day last month.Moon Jae In Theme stocks do not only draw an upward curve. Winova, another Moon Jae In-themed stock, was under the yoke of above the KOSDAQ's fall rate, recording a decline rate of . Winova is represented by Lee Seung-ryul, the son of Lee Sang-ho, chairman of the Woori Medical Foundation, who was the doctor of former President Roh Moo Hyun, and is woven into Moon Jae In theme stocks.Unlike other theme stocks, Winova did not fluctuate relatively much, but on the news that it decided to reduce the number of common shareholders, it hit the lower limit, increasing the drop.Another opposition party's presidential candidate, Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung, is also losing ground in KOSDAQ stocks. Jeong Da-woon was classified as Lee Jae-myung's theme stock because CEO Kim Sun-chul was an alumnus of Chung-Ang University like Mayor Lee, and showed a sharp rise at the end of last month and the end of last year when Lee's approval rating soared.Jeong Da-woon's stock price, which was last year's monthly price, rose to a record high during the day. However, stock prices have been on the decline since the new year and have been in a similar price range since mid-month last year.Hanjin Shipping and ship investment companies are among the stocks that heated up the month along with political theme stocks. Looking at the top to top of the monthly KOSPI's growth rate, ship investment companies that lend ships to Hanjin Shipping and Hanjin Shipping are located side by side. Korea's No. of Korea is on the rise, and Korea's No. of Korea is on the rise.Hanjin Shipping is expected to be liquidated, but individual investors have flocked since early this year, believing in the possibility of a slight recovery. Ship investment companies also saw their stock prices soar in similar cases.However, Hanjin Shipping has been designated as an investment risk item and daily trading transactions were suspended last month, which is considered to require investors' attention.

103,"JC Chemical, which recorded a rise from the previous day as of the morning due to poor performance compared to the industry average, rose. During the same period, the standard deviation, an indicator of stock price volatility, was recorded. This means that JC Chemical's monthly volatility was the smallest compared to major stocks in the chemical industry, so the stock price growth rate was relatively low within major stocks. As of recent months, the return on risk considering JC Chemical's risk was the lowest, but the return on risk was low because the stock price growth rate was not high. However, since the chemical industry's return on risk was lower than that, it is difficult to see the performance compared to the industry positively.Next, comparing the industry and the market, the chemical industry to which JC Chemical belongs has higher volatility and returns than the KOSDAQ index. In other words, it means that the index rose excessively as the industry gained momentum.

In terms of practicality, investors are showing a stable psychological state, and analyzing the arrangement of the moving averages increases the possibility of a shift to an upward phase as the continued decline ends.If you look at the distribution of sales in the last three months, it is necessary to consider the possibility of a relatively large trading range and a supply-demand resistance when the stock price rises, although the current stock price is weak, but it can act as a resistance in the future. Therefore, in the current situation where stock prices are rising in the short term, it is reasonable to put more weight on the resistance of the original price, and there is still a considerable distance to the price range, so there will be no major obstacles to further rise, and the role of the original resistance needs to wait a little longer.A reporter robot specializing in stock market analysis.It's written by Robots, an e-newspaper and Thinkpool stock market analyst E-newspaper Popular Post-newspaper Official Facebook E-newspaper Shortcut"

112,"The disclosure of embezzlement and breach of trust has exceeded last year's level, and listed companies have been suffering from a steadily increasing number of embezzlement and breach of trust cases in recent years. Investors are required to pay attention as financial soundness can worsen or lead to a sharp drop in stock prices.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service and the Korea Exchange, listed companies that have been involved in embezzlement and breach of trust in the securities and KOSDAQ markets this year have been counted as opening as of the date of confirmation of disclosure. Listed companies, which had embezzlement and breach of trust cases last year, were only introduced, but the number of listed companies increased to the previous year, and this year is already close to last year's level. Considering that the prosecution is investigating former executives and employees of Korea Aerospace on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust, it is likely to exceed last year's level.Listed companies that have been involved in embezzlement and breach of trust this year have been identified as Dong-A ST, Dong-A Socio Holdings, Dong-A, Intec, Orion Holdings Group, IG System, LS, SIT Global, KSP Winova, SillaJen, Samsung Electronics, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, and POSCO. From asset management, which is on the verge of extinction due to the uncertainty of its survival, to top market cap companies such as Samsung Electronics and POSCO, were listed in the embezzlement and breach of trust case.The number of cases of embezzlement and breach of trust by listed companies exceeded last year's level. The number of cases that have been in years has increased to years and has been recorded this year. This means that the number has nearly doubled in about a year. Among them, KOSDAQ-listed companies accounted for more than half of the total.The amount of embezzlement and breach of trust charges is recorded at an astronomical level every year. The cumulative annual accrual was recorded at 100 million won in the year and was counted at 100 million won this year. In particular, except for the large-scale embezzlement and breach of trust case, which is well known and is still underway, the amount incurred this year was the largest.Except for cases involving Samsung Electronics, which includes Lee Jae-yong, Vice Chairman Choi Ji-sung, and former POSCO Chairman Chung Joon-yang, former Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, the cumulative scale of the case is 100 million won. Considering that the amount excluding the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering incident last year and the Lotte Shopping case of Lotte Chemical, which the prosecution indicted the owner's family on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust, is more than double. In the year, the cumulative amount was about 100 million won, except for the embezzlement breach of trust filed by Chairman Chung Mong-sun against former Hyundai Cement executives.The duty to disclose and strengthening external audits are considered to be the background of a steady increase in embezzlement and breach of trust cases. The current disclosure regulations require mandatory disclosure regardless of the amount in cases of embezzlement and breach of trust involving executives of listed companies. Cases involving employees must be disclosed if the amount of embezzlement and breach of trust is more than equity capital.In addition, the regulations on external audits and accounting, revised at the end of last year, will target listed companies to be designated as auditors if the amount of embezzlement and breach of trust by executives of listed companies is greater than their equity capital. Depending on the size of the company, listed companies in the securities market will be designated as auditors in the event of embezzlement or breach of trust of equity capital if the total assets of KOSDAQ market are more than KRW 100 million.

114,"Bitcoins and other virtual currency prices are being displayed in real time at Bithumb, a virtual currency exchange in Jung-gu, Seoul, where virtual currency prices, which rebounded last weekend, fell again due to the abuse of dark coins such as Bitcoin.According to a survey, the size of virtual currency used to launder reporter Kang Jin-hyung's money amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars.Japanese virtual currency media quoted Cypertrace, a virtual currency security company, as saying this year's quarterly report. The report contains information on illegal activities such as virtual currency, crime, and money laundering that took place from last year to the first half of this year. The amount of virtual currency laundered through dark coins that cannot track transactions and remittances due to anonymous network processes such as Jet Cash Monero or Bitcoin tumblers that hide transaction details was found to reach billions of dollars.In particular, the size of the virtual currency seized in the first half of this year was a total of millions of dollars, double the annual damage of millions of dollars last year. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said virtual currency-related crimes received this year have doubled compared to last year.Cypertrace explained that the first step in using virtual currency for money laundering is cleansing to deposit cash into the virtual currency system. In the process, criminals used Bitcoin mixers, Bitcoin tumblers, etc. to anonymize virtual calls that transparently disclosed transactions such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. In addition, he also abused dark coins such as Jet Cash Monero. These virtual currencies are under surveillance by law enforcement authorities, including the U.S. Secret Service. In particular, Monero has been steadily suspected of being abused to raise funds from North Korea.The next step was to enter into numerous transactions, mixing the sources of fraudulent funds, and complicating transaction details. In the process, he also endured some of the profits falling due to fees. This is to make it difficult for investigative agencies to trace back the transaction route.Citing statistics, the report argued that the amount of virtual currency demanded as ransom in cybercrime is also increasing. It said it was around $10,000 last year and reached $10,000 this year until last month.Dave Danse, CEO of Cypertrace, said, ""As hacking attacks aimed at cryptocurrency and money laundering using cryptocurrency are increasing, financial authorities and judicial authorities should cooperate,"" and argued that global cryptocurrency regulations are also essential.Reporter Lee Minwoo...

They are in a position to hold them accountable for the worsening performance of falling stock prices.The minority shareholders' association convened an extraordinary shareholders' meeting at the Gyeongnam Tourism Hotel on next month, and proposed a bill to appoint a new director along with the dismissal of CEO Jung Joon-ki and others.

198,"As Cosen Bio was designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation one after another, a red light was turned on to maintain its listing. This is because if the cumulative penalty points of unfaithful disclosure corporations exceed the point or if the payment of paid-in capital increase and convertible bonds fails, it is likely to start a substantial examination of listing eligibility.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, the KOSDAQ market headquarters announced on the last day that Kosun Bio will be designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to its failure to disclose. This is because the company delayed the signing of a stock security provision contract accompanied by a change in the largest shareholder and the change in the largest shareholder due to the sale. It will be decided whether to designate an unfaithful disclosure corporation by this year's date.Earlier, Kosen Bio received a designated penalty point as an unfaithful disclosure corporation due to a change in the amount of paid-in capital increase issued. The penalty point was a point, but the final penalty point was reduced to a point due to the substitution of sanctions for violating the disclosure.The exchange will suspend transactions for listed companies whose penalty points exceed the annual point of an unfaithful disclosure corporation and will undergo a substantial examination of their eligibility for listing. If COSUNBIO exceeds the penalty point this time, it will be subject to a substantial review of its eligibility for listing.There are also concerns that the consecutive designation of unfaithful disclosure corporations may disrupt financing, including a paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million won.The Korea Center for Middle Particle Cancer Treatment, the former largest shareholder who was sold for sale this time, decided to raise funds. However, the prevailing view is that it will be virtually difficult to attract large-scale funds as Korean heavy investors have delayed payment of the cases several times.COSUNBIO changed the payment date of the paid-in capital increase of 1 billion won from 1 day to 1 day. Both the paid-in capital increase and those that have previously delayed payment by monthly and monthly can be postponed until a maximum of months.In particular, in order for Cosen Bio to not be designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation, it must attract at least KRW 100 million in funds. Investors' careful judgment is required in that it is more than twice the current market capitalization.An official from the securities industry said, ""The largest shareholder of COSUNBIO has been changed to former CEO Shin Ji-yoon due to opposition trading, but the board of directors has been appointed by Korea's intermediate shareholders at the extraordinary shareholders' meeting,"" adding, ""The company needs to restore confidence.""Reporter Kim Gunwoo...

199,"Stock prices are plunging as Kosen Bio has been designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation.As of 1 a.m., the stock price of COSUNBIO fell from the previous trading day.The Korea Exchange announced on the last day that it has designated Kosun Bio as an unfaithful disclosure corporation. This is because the reason for the change in disclosure was caught by changing the issuance amount of the paid-in capital increase more than that. The total penalty points imposed on Cosen Bio are the total points, but the final penalty points were set as points as the penalty for violating the disclosure was 10,000 won.In addition, the Korea Exchange announced the designation of Kosen Bio as an additional unfaithful disclosure corporation. This is why it announced it on the next month, even though it signed a stock security contract that entails a change in the largest shareholder on last month. The belated announcement of the change in the largest shareholder also went into the reason for the designation of an unfaithful disclosure corporation. The deadline for deciding whether to designate an unfaithful disclosure corporation is until next month.Shim Woo-Ji: Take a look at the new Seoul Economic Mobile Page.

200,"Considering the importance of the issue of the delayed disclosure period of stock collateral for the largest shareholder, Kosen Bio is also on the verge of being designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation. Since the penalty point has already been received earlier, if the additional penalty point exceeds the point, it will begin a substantial review of the eligibility for listing.According to the electronic disclosure of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, the KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange announced the previous day that it would designate Kosenbio as an unfaithful disclosure corporation. The deadline for the decision of an unfaithful disclosure corporation is until next month.The reason why Kosen Bio is designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation is that it has delayed the signing of a stock collateral offer contract that entails a change in the largest shareholder and the change in the largest shareholder.Stock prices plunged due to non-public sales during the day of the mortgage contract. Last month, Cosen Bio's largest shareholder, the Korea Center for Middle Particle Cancer, borrowed 100 million won from Jang Sung-hwan as collateral for Manchuria. On the same day, he left Manchuria as collateral and borrowed 100 million won from Lee Jin-ho.However, COSUNBIO did not disclose this. Under the Capital Markets Act, those who own more than their shares in listed companies must report and disclose collateral contracts that may cause changes in their shares to the Financial Services Commission and the Korea Exchange.In the meantime, Manju, a collateral stock, was sold in opposition. Last month, Manchuria was sold due to Jang's execution of security rights, and in the past, Manchuria was released to the market due to Lee's execution of security rights. Counter-selling is when the stock price falls to a certain level and the collateral value falls or the mortgage holder sells the stock.As large-scale supplies were released at once, ordinary investors experienced a plunge in stock prices without knowing why. When Manchuria was sold against the last day, Cosenbio went straight to the lower limit. Since then, the stock price has continued to fall, and the stock price, which exceeded the 1,000 won level last month, has now fallen to the 1,000 won level.If the penalty point is exceeded, Kosen Bio, which is close to being listed, could be subject to a substantial review of its eligibility for listing if it receives more than a penalty point due to the designation of an unfaithful disclosure corporation.According to KOSDAQ listing regulations, if the penalty point exceeds, the eligibility for listing will be reviewed. Earlier, Kosen Bio received penalty points for changing the amount of paid-in capital increase or more on the last day.The Korea Exchange imposes penalties by judging the delay period of disclosure or whether the issue is serious or intentional. In addition, if you have recently been sanctioned for violating public disclosure, penalty points will be added.Looking at the previous example, Wolhaeng Nam received penalty points for delaying the signing of a stock collateral provision contract involving a change in its largest shareholder. The date of occurrence of the cause was last month and the date of disclosure was. The disclosure was delayed by two days.Last month, YD Online announced the change of its largest shareholder by delaying it for a day and received penalties of 10 million won.COSUNBIO made a public announcement on the change of its largest shareholder on last month, but only on this month, it made a belated announcement. The disclosure was delayed by one day.Meanwhile, as of the morning that day, COSUNBIO was trading at 1,000 won, down from the previous day.Reporter Jang Hyo Won.

201,"In three months, the attempt to merge without capital on KOSDAQ-listed Kosen Bio, which is estimated to be a capital gain, failed due to the sudden rise in the market price of new businesses such as Major Shareholder Change Bio. However, it is estimated that some forces have made significant capital gains in this process.According to the Japan Financial Supervisory Service and the financial investment industry, Cosenbio, which changed its largest shareholder from Shin Ji-yoon's name to Korea's middle particle cancer treatment center, announced on the last day that its largest shareholder changed to Shin Ji-yoon's name again in three months.This is because after acquiring shares and management rights from Shin, the existing CEO and largest shareholder, the new major shareholder, who was seeking to boost stock prices and raise funds by setting up new board members and adding business purposes such as bio, was sold against.Initially, the new major shareholder decided to bring Manju for 100 million won in the process of acquiring the stake, but only the down payment of 100 million won was paid, and the shares acquired under a contract for a money consumption loan were entrusted as collateral. Since then, as large-scale financing has been delayed one after another and stock prices have fallen, stocks that were entrusted as collateral have been sold in large quantities, leaving only Manchuria.Korea Heavy Particle Cancer Treatment Center is a company led by Cho Kyu-myeon, who had reached delisting when he was CEO of Unid Korea in the past. In the end, Cho took over a KOSDAQ-listed company with only KRW 100 million and attempted to boost stock prices in the name of a new bio business, but the operation was virtually canceled due to the fall in stock prices.In the process, unfaithful disclosures have also become a problem. The Korea Exchange designated CONSUNBIO as an unfaithful disclosure corporation on the last day, imposing penalty points, saying that it changed the abnormalities of the issuance amount of paid-in capital increase. As a result, the trading of CosenBio will be suspended for one day.The stock price of COSUNBIO has plummeted more than last month's high. Stock prices continued to fall as work such as raising funds flowed smoothly, and as a result, stock prices fell even more sharply as new major shareholders sold stocks as collateral. In the past, it has plummeted for nearly a day. However, the stock price, which had been below the original won last month, soared to the won in about a month along with related news, raising the possibility that some forces made a large profit in a short period of time.CONSUNBIO is seeking to issue bonds with new stock rights worth KRW 100 million and convertible bonds, but the payment date has been delayed to next year due to a series of delays in the payment of funds. Although the paid-in capital increase, which is being promoted on a scale of 100 million won, is also due to the date of payment, it is unlikely that the actual payment will be made because the subject of the bequest is the Korea Center for Middle Particle Cancer. As of the end of last year, the company was in a state of capital erosion with a total capital of minus 10,000 won.An official from the financial investment industry urged special attention to investment, saying that those who cannot afford capital tried to boost stock prices in the name of new businesses such as bio, but failed.Kim Dae-woong, Naver Home, YDaily News, Full of Fun, Youth Nuus Comprehensive Economic Information Media, EDaily Reproduction of Unauthorized Transactions is prohibited"
